Let me tell you how you can make more than $2,500\/month through your own sex toy business.\r\n\r\nToday I will cover this comprehensive guide on making money when you sell sex toys online. The complete guide will cover the most important question - How to start a sex toy business?\r\n\r\nStarting a sex toy business and profiting from it is not that difficult, I have done it you can replicate the same process.\r\n\r\nMany of you have been complaining that I am covering more webcam model stuff recently and I don't blame you. But you have to understand that since this website is about Adult money-making methods, and my experience is in adult industry I have to cater to all categories\r\n\r\nI have been receiving numerous email from you guys regarding selling adult toys online. So here are few questions that I received from you guys over the months:\r\n\r\n \tHow to make money selling sex toys online?\r\n \tCan I create passive income by starting an adult sex toys store online?\r\n \tIs adult sex toys business still profitable?\r\n \tHow to sell adult sex toys online?\r\n \tHow to drive traffic to my adult sex toys store?\r\n \tWhat is the current state of adult toys business in 2017 and how does its future looks like?\r\n\r\nToday I will cater to all these questions and help you understand how all of this works. So without wasting any time, let's start this complete guide\r\nSelling Sex toys online - the complete guide\r\nWhats the current state of adult sex toy business?\r\nThere are some giants and many websites that sell \u00a0sex toys online. It is just like Adult tube websites\u00a0that if you try to create a general all category website then your chances of making money are negligible as the giants like Pornhub, xvideos rule the adult tube industry and you will never be able to drive traffic.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, if you are thinking of driving traffic to your adult sex toy store then you need to niche it down. If you are thinking of starting sex toys website then you have to select a niche and then build upon it\r\n\r\nInstead of selling all sex toys, just sell dildos,\u00a0and then sell all the variety of dildos possible\r\n\r\nWhy should I niche it down? ?\r\n\r\nThere are many reasons:\r\n\r\n \tThe traffic to your sex toy business will he highly targeted and relevant\r\n \tMore chances of making a purchase\r\n \tGoogle gives enormous\u00a0advantage to niche website in search engine rankings, so you will be driving free and amaizng organic traffic to your adult toys online store\r\n\r\nBut you have to understand that you are not creating a blog or content website. Since you are selling a product SEO will not play many roles here so your only bet is spending money to drive traffic to your website\r\nSex toy industry - some insights\r\nSex toy industry proudly stands at more than $15 billion with projections for 2020 being more than $50 billion\r\n\r\nWith people becoming more and more sexually active and everyone trying to add more pleasure in their sex life, this industry and is booming and you can easily take a big chunk of this pie by starting your own sex toy site by following this guide\r\n\r\nAlso after the release fo 50 shades of grey movie and novels, the demand for sex toys have skyrocketed\r\nHow to start a sex toy business?\r\nMillions of adults are looking for ways to spice up their sex life and add some excitement to the bedroom. By starting a sex toy business and finding these adults, you can easily build and scale your sex toys website\r\n\r\nI have covered everything in this article for you to know to start your sex toy website online.\r\nHow to sell sex toys and how will drive traffic?\r\nWe have covered the driving traffic part later in this article. You need to use PPC (Pay per click) advertisement for driving targeted traffic to your website\r\n\r\n \tUse SEMrush to first make a list of you keywords that you will use. It's a great tool which will give you all the information that you need to find the best keyword for you. Use this SEMRUSH Coupon for free trail of its guru account\r\n \tBuy PPC advertisement for your target Keywords\r\n \tCheck your conversion rates, optimize and then optimize more and try to shoot the conversion rate up\r\n\r\n \tFactors like checkout process, website loading speed, ease of checkout, product description, reviews and many other factors decide persons buying decision so research more on that\r\n\r\n\r\n \tFind the difference between your expense and revenue that will be your profit\r\n\r\nHow shall I create an adult sex toys website?\r\nIf you try to create everything by yourself it will be extremely time-consuming and difficult since you have to do all the work. There are two options for you\r\nWhitelabel\u00a0website\r\nYou can sign up at a white label website and then sell products and earn a commission. This website will handle everything from hosting, dropshipping, platform, payment processing and all\r\n\r\nYou will make 40-60% commission\u00a0on the sales. The disadvantages of using a free white label solution are:\r\n\r\n \tThey have preloaded templates, so very fewer changes can be made\r\n \tObviously, they will take the money \u00a0for their platform\r\n \tNot so scalable as you don't have much customization option\r\n \tYou cannot sell your website later. \u00a0Selling is white label sex toy website is a nightmare, my friend.\r\n\r\nSome white\u00a0label\u00a0are free and some charge a one-time fee (~$2000) plus a monthly pricing of approximately $150\/month but that will add a lot of pressure on you to make profit from this website, I never recommend this method\r\nCreate it yourself\r\nSince I have had my love for WordPress for long so I have always created all my website through it. Here are the steps\r\n\r\n \tBuy a adult friendly hosting - (i recommend hostgator, I use the same for my adult sex store)\r\n \tI brought a great looking WordPress theme, with wooCommerce plugin. Great management of products and cart etc. You can easily find a great Adult Ecommerce theme on Themeforest.com.\r\n \tUse an adult payment gateway\u00a0 and you are good to go\r\n \tUsed a drop shipping API for drop shipping adult sex toys products\r\n\r\nSince it is your own theme there are multiple customization options. Also, these themes are built by professional so they are already amazing looking. Make sure the following points are checked on the website:\r\n\r\n \tThe website is extremely fast to load. I have written an article on this\u00a0Speed up Website and Decrease WordPress Page Load time\r\n \tMake sure the website is mobile optimized. Google has started giving enormous advantage to mobile optimized website and hence make sure your website design is responsive\r\n \tAdult SEO is correctly done. Check out Adult SEO guide, and other articles in Adult SEO section to learn the ins and outs of properly optimizing your adult sex toys website\u00a0for search engines\r\n\r\nWhat are some popular and best sex toy websites online for some inspiration\r\nHere is a list of few\r\n\r\n \tLovehoney\r\n \tAmazon\r\n \tSimply pleasure\r\n \tNice and Naughty\r\n \tEsmale\r\n \tHonour\r\n\r\nWhere will i get the products and how will the products be shipped to my customers?\r\nIf you are importing\u00a0the products from China for selling it yourself then there is that. There is another way to make money and that is using affiliate income. You can drive the targeted customers to your website and then drive them to websites like lovehoney.\r\n\r\nWhen they buy the adult toys\u00a0through your affiliate link you will get a great commission (20%) approximately\r\n\r\nIf you have contact with vendors then you can do that as well\r\n\r\nThe other thing that most people do is dropshipping. If you don't know what drop shipping is then let me tell you that first.\r\nWhat is adult dropshipping?\r\nWhen you as a sex toy website owner don't have your own products stored in a warehouse but rather wants to sell someone else product without handling the logistics that is dropshipping. You are just selling the product, shipping and delivery are taken care by the drop shipper. You list the product, sell it, make your commission and then enjoy the money\r\n\r\nHow can i find drop shippers: You can search on Google, use forum to get the high quality ones, the few I know are: Adultdropshipper.com etc\r\n\r\nThe best part about adult dropshipping is that you don't have to invest a huge amount of money upfront in \u00a0order to maintain the inventory for selling these products. With minimum investment, you can just create\u00a0your sex store website.\r\n\r\nFinding a good drop shipper must be a priority and you must find someone who has experience and is cooperative. also, talk with him about the refunds or exchange of product policy. This issue becomes problematic later\r\n\r\nYou don't have to worry about the company name not mentioned on the product. Here are the steps:\r\n\r\n \tCustomer makes \u00a0a purchase on your website and pays you money\r\n \tYou receive an email about a sale.\r\n \tYou go to drop shippers website and place an order of same product or you can also use API to automate this process\r\n \tThe drop shipper will send the product with your Company logo \u00a0and packaging\r\n \tYou also don't have to worry about the packaging being discreet as they are experienced player and they know the sensitive nature of the products being sent\r\n\r\nYou just login to the dropshippers website put in the details and he will ship the product. For automation, you can use the API to automate the process\r\nOk, i have a website but how will I drive targeted traffic to my website. What should be my marketing and promotion strategy for\u00a0selling sex toys online?\r\nDriving traffic has been the considered the most difficult and most troubling for any website owner. I totally agree as just like you even I want to have thousands of targeted visitor to my website the moment I launch my business\r\n\r\nThere are multiple ways of driving traffic to your website and we will go through them one by one\r\n\r\n \tAdult forums\r\n \tAdult friendly social media especially twitter\r\n \tAdult Ad networks and adult PPC campaigns\r\n \tAdult Media Buying\r\n \tAdult SEO\r\n\r\nDriving adult traffic for sex toy website through adult forums\r\nActively become a good participant in these forums. Engage and give useful value to the forum and soon you will be loved by the people. A quick search on Adult sex toys forums a then checking their traffic stats at similarweb.com and checking their Alexa rank will give you an idea about the quality of that forum\r\n\r\nBy actively participating you will become a useful member and then transferring traffic to your website will become easier over time. If you have enough money then you can also try buying advertising space on this website and then check the ROI, if it is highly positive then buy the banners for a longer time\r\nDriving adult traffic for sex toys website through Twitter\r\nAlthough twitter does not allow promotion of adult sex toys but people are still doing it without any problem. Use IFTTT for automating everything. Just automate all the tweets, tweet regular and smartly. Select your hashtags wisely. There are websites which give statistics for hashtags use, so try to make a comprehensive list of what hashtags gives the best result for adult sex toys\r\n\r\nTarget the consumers as well, if someone has tweeted about their experience, or someone is in need for one then they are your target customer.Retweeting such tweets will help\r\n\r\nDriving adult traffic for adult sex toy website through PPC campaigns\r\nYou can use Google and bing ads to drive target customers to your website and check the ROI for better conversions\r\nDriving adult traffic for your sex toy business through Adult media buying\r\nMedia buying can be extremely beneficial as well as tempting to lose it all if you don't do it correctly. You have to do extensive research, start many campaigns, optimize and optimize more and then select the winners and forget about the losers\r\n\r\nThere are many sources for your media buying like Trafficjunky, juicyads and many more. You have to understand what you are selling and where your target customers reside. So first make a list of such website and then either contact them directly or buy the spots through media buying website\r\n\r\nApart from Adult media buying you can also contact the webmasters that rank higher on your target keyword and then contact them for negotiating the rates for placing banners on their websites\r\nDriving adult traffic for sex toy website through Tumblr, Stumbleupon, and Reddit\r\nAll of these have an NSFW sections\u00a0and hence you won't face much problem promoting your products here. If you directly put your product page link you won't succeed so you need to give then some interesting content and then drive the traffic from there to your website\r\n\r\nHave you started you own sex toy business?

Many countries do not allow the sale of sex toys online. While countries like the US have no issues for sex toys sale online. If you are in a country outside the US then I will advise you to first check the laws or hire a lawyer before moving forward.\r\n\r\nAs I have always preached, that adult sex toy business or any money making method in adult industry must first be verified and laws be checked before entering into one\r\n\r\nFor example selling sex toys in Malaysia and India is illegal, although companies like iambesharam and others are finding loopholes to operate. In Japan, companies are being smart by making dildos in the shape of animals and cartoon characters to sell\r\n\r\nIn the US sex toys have become increasingly available in various stores such as Walmart and others. Also, amazon has taken the biggest pie of sex toy industry by selling sex toys at a much cheaper price compared to other sex toys seller\r\nGetting your numbers right\r\nWhenever you are starting a business, you need to have a strong control of the financials.

But honestly, it requires a lot of time and investment. Two things which are extremely important for me. So I won't be covering this in detail and also will advise you to stay away from such business ideas\r\n\r\nAlready I have shared so many money making methods on this website, follow one of them instead and make money on autopilot just like me\r\nTurnkey adult websites\r\nAdult turnkey websites are those that make huge promises like they will help you make $10,000\/month if you buy their product. Since you are a beginner and this sounds too good, you might be tempted to make a purchase and shell out your hard earned money\r\n\r\nAdult novelty fulfillment and adult sex toy business consulting scam is also going on these days. Many fake websites have started giving these consulting gigs and are looking for potential beginner customers like you, so make sure you don't get entangled in their web of deceit.\r\n\r\nturnkey sex toy website are everywhere, and promise for huge payouts like 20-30% if also given\r\n\r\nMost novelty adult turnkey sites will never gain organic traffic because all they are doing is spreading the duplicate content.
