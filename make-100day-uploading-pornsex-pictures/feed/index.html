<description><![CDATA[Hi Steve,
I have one question, I just got a domain name and hosting, but my site does not rank, I mean when I type the domain into google it does not show my site, I mean people will have to write the domain in the google search (they can&#039;t copy the link, it is not clickable on the image itself)? I have redirected my domain to a crackrevenue offer and it works fine, but when I write the domain name into google search it does not show up??? any advice?]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The landing page is needed to convert more for the offer of crakrevenue?  
Generally speaking for any offers the landing page is nearly a must to get more conversions and do you think it is nearly a must for more conversions?]]></description>
