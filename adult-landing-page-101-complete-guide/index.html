The headline and the opening face of your landing page. The header must use a simple and effective heading that can correspond of the visitors problem and also offer them a working solution for the same. It should be clearly designed, must have great colors, relatable pictures or background and clear looking text</p><p>This includes your title and title is very crucial for the effectiveness of your landing page. An attention grabbing title is what you desire. If you are thinking I don’t know how to write title or I don’t want to do the work for writing good title, worry not I have covered that area for you as well</p><p>Frist you must understand that even small changes in your title can affect you conversion rate and this is why A/B testing your title is a crucial step</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here are some ways to write amazing title for your landing page:</p><ol><li>Give them facts or numbers. People love actionable advice which involves a number. Fro example: Fuck 10 girls in one week – Proven step-by-step formula</li><li>Make it super simple for your customers. The only way to fuck multiple girls without going out of your home</li></ol><p>There are thousand other amazing titles that people use. Use google to find high converting pages like these and get inspired</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Body of your adult landing page</strong></h2><p>One thing you learn that will skyrocket your conversion is speaking your customers language. Here is customer is the visitor to your landing page. They are already interested in what you are selling since they are on your landing page. Now you just need to convince them that you are selling an amazing product that will clearly fulfill the desire they have. This will only help if you use the language that your customer use.</p><p>For writing great copy you need to first research about the problem that your product is solving. See forums, blog comments, quora, reddit and see the language people are using for describing their problem. By speaking the language of your customer you are easily able to connect with them</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Keep your message and text of landing page, simple, clear so that your visitor understands the overall uniqueness of your product within seconds. No one has the time to read everything that your put across in your landing page</p><p>Make every element relatable, if you are adding a video message make sure it is peersonlau=ized and also the message is in context to what you are selling. You have to connect with your audience emotionally</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Call to action of your adult landing page</strong></h2><p>You have followed all the advice and have even created a great looking landing page, but without a call to action its like a car without the petrol. You need the visitor to take a specific action while he/she is going through the natural progression of their landing page. Here comes the part of Call to action. I have already written article on what makes a great call to action, check it here: <a href="http://makemoneyadultcontent.com/creating-call-to-actions-adult-media-buying/">Creating Call to Actions &amp;#8211; Adult Media Buying</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Call to action is another crucial part of your landing page. Make sure you have a clearly visible call to action. You don’t have to keep the visitors guessing what teir next step should be rather drive them naturally to your call to action so that they can move forward with the next step that you desire them to take, like buying the product or creating and account</p><p>Make sure you have multiple call to actions, one in the header or above the fold and one later below the page when the visitor has scrolled through the landing page</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>TIP:</strong> </span>make sure you landing page is mobile-optimized. As mentioned on many websites that mobile traffic is surpassing all kind of traffic for your website. I have a network of website and even in my google analytics I can see that approximately 50-60% of traffic is coming from mobile phones</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These were the tips and my advice for creating an amazing and results oriented landing page. Now lets move forward to other important stuff that is equally important and needs proper mentioning</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you have starting testing your landing pages now, then you must already have seen a boost in your conversions. You might be smiling and already be writing an email to me for a thankyou (by the way you can do that at <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#7a1915140e1b190e3a171b111f1715141f031b1e0f160e1915140e1f140e5419151753"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="fc9f9392889d9f88bc919d979991939299859d988990889f939288999288d29f9391">[email&#160;protected]</span><script data-cfhash='f9e31' type="text/javascript">/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */</script>)</a>. But that is not all. What if I tell you that you can still double or triple your conversion rates. Yes it is possible and that my friend comes through A/B testing your adult landing page</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I have already written an article about what A/B testing is check it here before proceeding: <a href="http://makemoneyadultcontent.com/ab-testing-adult-ads-media-buying/">A/B testing adult ads &amp;#8211; media buying</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A/B testing is extremely crucial if you are selling something. You need to have the best conversion for your landing page and that will be accompanied only by testing various version of your landing page and then keeping the highest converting one</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Here is how you do the A/B testing of your adult landing page the right way:</strong></p><ol><li>Testing one parameter at a time. If you are testing too many areas then how will you decide which parameter is affecting the increased or decreased conversion rate</li></ol><p>If you are sending traffic to various landing pages from various ad banners you wont be able to decide which one is working for your as you have no idea for where the traffic is coming. So rather go slowly, here are the steps:</p><ol><li>Choose one ad banner that gives you high clicks</li><li>Now A/B test various versions of your landing page and see which version gives you the most conversions</li><li>Voila, you have found the highest converting adult landing page for your product</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Note: You have to understand one thing. These tests are highly varying and the results might differ for some different traffic source.This is no exact scince to need to keep testing and adapting in order to get high conversions. It&#8217;s not like one type of landing page will fit everywhere</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What are the types of Adult Landing pages?</strong></h2><p>Depending on the type of results you want there are twi types of landing pages:</p><ol><li>Lead capturing adult landing pages: This is like normal lead generating landing pages so that you can connect the email address and then convert them later by sequencing the emails . This is the most prominent way of how internet marketing industry is making all the money</li><li>Click-Through Adult landing page: This is the kind of landing page that we talked about a lot in the above information. Warming the audience about your product so that before taking them to the sales page you have convinced your visitors enough to help them decide to make the purchase</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lets decipher a perfect landing page so that you can create and convert like crazy. You need to understand the basic elements of a landing page and also connect them coherently in order to get high conversion rate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Clearly establish what you are selling to your audience</strong></h2><p>If you cannot describe in clear and concise manner what you are selling then the conversion rates are hit badly. The primary title is very crucial and you must test various version of it to see how well it is helping.</p><p>You can also use Hotjar to see how people are navigating through your landing page. You will be able to check , how they are scrolling, how their mouse is moving and all such important information.</p><p>Subtitle is also very crucial. If you see any popular online courses you will see a highly creative and enticing title, along with a great subtitle that is supporting the title very effectively. A sub title also help in clearing the confusion and describing your product in few words</p><h2></h2><h2><strong>Using video for high conversions in an adult landing page</strong></h2><p>Using media elements in your landing page can really enhance the conversion rate.Especially video elements are believed to be more realistic and creates a better connect with the audience. If you check Leadpages ( a leading landing page company) they also use Video in their own company promoting landing page</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Highlighting the benefits and advantages of the product on your adult landing page</strong></h2><p>This is where you have to show off in a very natural looking way. You don’t want to come across as to salesy while also highlight in the key benefits of your product. You can do this with the help of a story, bullet point sin clear and concise manner. Or paragraphs explaining them. Using the customer language becomes very important here as they should feel as if their own subconscious is peaking directly in front of them</p><p>They should feel, yes that’s exactly the problem I have and then your solution will solve the problem</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Capturing your Visitors attention and faith </strong></h2><p>You can do this through various ways. A great way is video testimonials. They are working really great these way as the doubt of having a fake testimonial is removed completely. If you cannot get video testimonials, then make sure get customers comments through your Facebook group (if you have any). Or ask your previous customer to write a realistic testimonials to help you put in the landing page</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Brining in the urgency to get more conversions</strong></h2><p>This has been a tried and tested formula when getting higher conversions. If you can show a timer that states that the offer will expire in 7 days or 48 hours then that creates a urgency in the visitor&#8217;s mind and hence you can get a higher conversion rate as well</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now lets talk about the important stuff. The two most important part of your adult landing page:</p><ol><li>Title of your adult landing page</li><li>Call to action (CTA) of your adult landing page</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is no doubt that these are the two most important areas of your landing page and can make or break your conversion rates. If you are into adult affiliate marketing then this will be extremely crucial for your success</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For getting better at improving conversion of your landing page is test and more testing. One better way is to learn from the pros, and this is why I would ask you to read blogs of unbounce.com , leadpages.net . These two companies have millions of impressions on their landing pages and hence have statistics to back their claim. Learn from them, get inspired and test various new tricks and tips on your landing pages and see how it affects your conversion.</p><p>If you don’t want to do this then you can hire a freelancer who have expertise In building landing pages and ask him to do all the work, title, copywriting , CTA etc</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some other important articles that you must check out:</p><ul><li><a href="http://makemoneyadultcontent.com/adult-affiliate-link-masking-explained/">Adult Affiliate link Masking Explained</a></li><li><a href="../doi-soi-affiliate-marketing-terms/index.html">What is DOI and SOI affiliate marketing terms</a></li><li>Adult affiliate marketing Make Easy Money</li></ul><p><strong> </strong></p><p>I hope you like this article on Adult Landing Page 101 , the Complete guide for Making money as an Adult Affiliate.

You need the visitor to take a specific action while he\/she is going through the natural progression of their landing page. Here comes the part of Call to action. I have already written article on what makes a great call to action, check it here: Creating Call to Actions &amp;#8211; Adult Media Buying\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nCall to action is another crucial part of your landing page. Make sure you have a clearly visible call to action. You don\u2019t have to keep the visitors guessing what teir next step should be rather drive them naturally to your call to action so that they can move forward with the next step that you desire them to take, like buying the product or creating and account\r\n\r\nMake sure you have multiple call to actions, one in the header or above the fold and one later below the page when the visitor\u00a0has scrolled through the landing page\r\n\r\nTIP: make sure you landing page is mobile-optimized. As mentioned on many websites that mobile traffic is surpassing all kind of traffic for your website. I have a network of website and even in my google analytics I can see that approximately 50-60% of traffic is coming from mobile phones\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThese were the tips and my advice for creating an amazing and results oriented landing page. Now lets move forward to other important stuff that is equally important and needs proper mentioning\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf you have starting testing your landing pages now, then you must already have seen a boost in your conversions. You might be smiling and already be writing an email to me for a thankyou (by the way you can do that at contact@makemoneyadultcontent.com). But that is not all. What if I tell you that you can still double or triple your conversion rates. Yes it is possible and that my friend comes through A\/B testing your adult landing page\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI have already written an article about what A\/B testing is check it here before proceeding: A\/B testing adult ads &amp;#8211; media buying\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA\/B testing is extremely crucial if you are selling something. You need to have the best conversion for your landing page and that will be accompanied only by testing various version of your landing page and then keeping the highest converting one\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHere is how you do the A\/B testing of your adult landing page the right way:\r\n\r\n \tTesting one parameter at a time. If you are testing too many areas then how will you decide which parameter is affecting the increased or decreased conversion rate\r\n\r\nIf you are sending traffic to various landing pages from various ad banners you wont be able to decide which one is working for your as you have no idea for where the traffic is coming. So rather go slowly, here are the steps:\r\n\r\n \tChoose one ad banner that gives you high clicks\r\n \tNow A\/B test various versions of your landing page and see which version gives you the most conversions\r\n \tVoila, you have found the highest converting adult landing page for your product\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNote: You have to understand one thing. These tests are highly varying and the results might differ for some different traffic source.This is no exact scince to need to\u00a0keep testing\u00a0and adapting in order to get high conversions. It's not like one type of landing page will fit everywhere\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nWhat are the types of Adult Landing pages?\r\nDepending on the type of results you want there are twi types of landing pages:\r\n\r\n \tLead capturing adult landing pages: This is like normal lead generating landing pages so that you can connect the email address and then convert them later by sequencing the emails . This is the most prominent way of how internet marketing industry is making all the money\r\n \tClick-Through Adult landing page: This is the kind of landing page that we talked about a lot in the above information. Warming the audience about your product so that before taking them to the sales page you have convinced your visitors enough to help them decide to make the purchase\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nLets decipher a perfect landing page so that you can create and convert like crazy. You need to understand the basic elements of a landing page and also connect them coherently in order to get high conversion rate.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nClearly establish what you are selling to your audience\r\nIf you cannot describe in clear and concise manner what you are selling then the conversion rates are hit badly. The primary title is very crucial and you must test various version of it to see how well it is helping.\r\n\r\nYou can also use Hotjar to see how people are navigating through your landing page. You will be able to check , how they are scrolling, how their mouse is moving and all such important information.\r\n\r\nSubtitle is also very crucial. If you see any popular online courses you will see a highly creative and enticing title, along with a great subtitle that is supporting the title very effectively. A sub title also help in clearing the confusion and describing your product in few words\r\n\r\nUsing video for high conversions in an adult landing page\r\nUsing media elements in your landing page can really enhance the conversion rate.Especially video elements are believed to be more realistic and creates a better connect with the audience. If you check Leadpages ( a leading landing page company) they also use Video in their own company promoting landing page\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nHighlighting the benefits and advantages of the product on your adult landing page\r\nThis is where you have to show off in a very natural looking way. You don\u2019t want to come across as to salesy while also highlight in the key benefits of your product. You can do this with the help of a story, bullet point sin clear and concise manner. Or paragraphs explaining them. Using the customer language becomes very important here as they should feel as if their own subconscious is peaking directly in front of them\r\n\r\nThey should feel, yes that\u2019s exactly the problem I have and then your solution will solve the problem\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nCapturing your Visitors attention and faith \r\nYou can do this through various ways. A great way is video testimonials. They are working really great these way as the doubt of having a fake testimonial is removed completely. If you cannot get video testimonials, then make sure get customers comments through your Facebook group (if you have any). Or ask your previous customer to write a realistic testimonials to help you put in the landing page\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nBrining in the urgency to get more conversions\r\nThis has been a tried and tested formula when getting higher conversions. If you can show a timer that states that the offer will expire in 7 days or 48 hours then that creates a urgency in the visitor's mind and hence you can get a higher conversion rate as well\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNow lets talk about the important stuff. The two most important part of your adult landing page:\r\n\r\n \tTitle of your adult landing page\r\n \tCall to action (CTA) of your adult landing page\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that these are the two most important areas of your landing page and can make or break your conversion rates. If you are into adult affiliate marketing then this will be extremely crucial for your success\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFor getting better at improving conversion of your landing page is test and more testing. One better way is to learn from the pros, and this is why I would ask you to read blogs of unbounce.com , leadpages.net . These two companies have millions of impressions on their landing pages and hence have statistics to back their claim. Learn from them, get inspired and test various new tricks and tips on your landing pages and see how it affects your conversion.\r\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t want to do this then you can hire a freelancer who have expertise In building landing pages and ask him to do all the work, title, copywriting , CTA etc\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSome other important articles that you must check out:\r\n\r\n \tAdult Affiliate link Masking Explained\r\n \tWhat is DOI and SOI affiliate marketing terms\r\n \tAdult affiliate marketing Make Easy Money\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI hope you like this article on Adult Landing Page 101 , the Complete guide for Making money as an Adult Affiliate.

Check out my journey into adult tube and how you can also make $3500 per month here: http://makemoneyadultcontent.com/my-journey-to-3500-per-month-from-adult-tube-websites/</div><div class="clear"></div></div></div></div><div id="footer-second" class="footer-widgets-box"><div id="widget_sp_image-38" class="footer-widget widget_sp_image"><div class="footer-widget-top"><h4></h4></div><div class="footer-widget-container"><a href="../hostgator-review-best-web-hosting-adult-porn-websites/index.html" target="_blank" class="widget_sp_image-image-link" title="Adult web hosting image"><img width="300" height="300" alt="Adult web hosting image" class="attachment-full aligncenter" style="max-width: 100%;" src="../wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Adult-web-hosting-image.jpg"/></a></div></div></div></div><div class="clear"></div> </footer><div class="clear"></div><div class="footer-bottom"><div class="container"><div class="alignright"> MakeMoneyAdultContent</div><div class="social-icons"> <a class="ttip-none" title="Google+" href="https://plus.google.com/104122591300920316731/about" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-google-plus"></i></a><a class="ttip-none" title="Facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/makemoneyadultcontent/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-facebook"></i></a><a class="ttip-none" title="Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/makemoneyadult" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a><a class="ttip-none" title="Youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxHkthrmiQZV8C-ybg9knnQ" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-youtube"></i></a></div><div class="alignleft"> © Copyright 2017, All Rights Reserved</div><div class="clear"></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="topcontrol" class="fa fa-angle-up" title="Scroll To Top"></div><div id="fb-root"></div><div id="tve_notification_box"></div><div id="reading-position-indicator"></div><script type='text/javascript'>var wpcf7={"apiSettings":{"root":"http:\/\/www.makemoneyadultcontent.com\/wp-json\/","namespace":"contact-form-7\/v1"},"recaptcha":{"messages":{"empty":"Please verify that you are not a robot."}},"cached":"1"};</script> <script type='text/javascript'>var tie={"mobile_menu_active":"true","mobile_menu_top":"","lightbox_all":"true","lightbox_gallery":"true","woocommerce_lightbox":"yes","lightbox_skin":"dark","lightbox_thumb":"vertical","lightbox_arrows":"","sticky_sidebar":"1","is_singular":"1","SmothScroll":"true","reading_indicator":"true","lang_no_results":"No Results","lang_results_found":"Results Found"};</script> <script type='text/javascript'>var tve_dash_front={"ajaxurl":"http:\/\/www.makemoneyadultcontent.com\/wp-admin\/admin-ajax.php","is_crawler":""};</script> <script type='text/javascript'>var embedVars={"disqusConfig":{"platform":"wordpress@4.8","language":""},"disqusIdentifier":"2353 http:\/\/makemoneyadultcontent.com\/?p=2353","disqusShortname":"makemoneyadultcontent","disqusTitle":"Adult Landing Page 101 \u2013 Complete guide for Making money as an Adult Affiliate","disqusUrl":"http:\/\/www.makemoneyadultcontent.com\/adult-landing-page-101-complete-guide\/","options":{"manualSync":false},"postId":"2353"};</script> <script type='text/javascript' src='../wp-content/cache/busting/1/wp-content-plugins-disqus-comment-system-media-js-disqus.js'></script> <script type='text/javascript'>var countVars={"disqusShortname":"makemoneyadultcontent"};</script> <script type='text/javascript' src='../wp-content/cache/busting/1/wp-content-plugins-disqus-comment-system-media-js-count.js'></script> <script src="../wp-content/cache/min/1/af14526a2720d8448ad16c689235e807.js" data-minify="1"></script><script src="../wp-content/cache/min/1/a6392da21f23cde725be0a71001f7810.js" data-minify="1"></script><script>/* <![CDATA[ */(function(d,s,a,i,j,r,l,m,t){try{l=d.getElementsByTagName('a');t=d.createElement('textarea');for(i=0;l.length-i;i++){try{a=l[i].href;s=a.indexOf('/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection');m=a.length;if(a&&s>-1&&m>28){j=28+s;s='';if(j<m){r='0x'+a.substr(j,2)|0;for(j+=2;j<m&&a.charAt(j)!='X';j+=2)s+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(j,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);j++;s=decodeURIComponent(s)+a.substr(j,m-j)}t.innerHTML=s.replace(/</g,'&lt;').replace(/\>/g,'&gt;');l[i].href='mailto:'+t.value}}catch(e){}}}catch(e){}})(document);/* ]]> */</script></body>
