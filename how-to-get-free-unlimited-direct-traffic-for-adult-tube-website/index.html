For this you can start by searching for a similar tube website which is focused on the same niche as yours and then downloading the popular videos from that website.</p><p>OR you can visit popular tube websites and then after searching for the keywords of your niche, <strong>downloading the high quality Popular videos with many likes</strong></p><p><em>(NOTE: Check our <a href="../adult-webmaster-resources/index.html" target="_blank">RESOURCES</a> page to learn all the tools and websites i use to make more than $5,000 per month. Majority of them are free and you can acheive the same results if you follow my advice)</em></p><p>OR you can find the key companies in the niche of your website which make videos and sell them or subscription based model. Then search for the torrents or download links of those videos and downloading those videos.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lets start with step <strong><em>2. Edit the video to add branding of your website</em></strong></p><p>The videos you download using Ant video downloader plugin will be in .FLV format. I use Adobe Premiere Pro to edit my videos but sadly it does not allow .flv videos to be edited and hence i use a video converter software named as &#8220;<a href="http://www.effectmatrix.com/total-video-converter/" target="_blank">Total video converter</a>&#8221; for converting my videos from .flv to .wmv. If you have any other Video editor which allows .flv videos to be edited then you do not need this extra step of converting the videos from .flv to .mp4 or .wmv.</p><p>First of off let me tell you the kind of branding that we will be adding to the video</p><ul><li>A five second image before the start of video</li><li>A five second Image at the end of Video</li><li>Our website logo throughout entire video length at one of the corners</li></ul><p><em>How to select the image?</em></p><p>For this all you have to do is go to Google images and search the primary keyword of your niche and adding the word &#8220;wallpaper&#8221; with it. For example if your niche is foot fetish, then on Google image search use the query &#8220;Foot fetish wallpaper&#8221; and then download a high definition photo which relates to your niche.</p><p>Now we have to edit this photo to add some text on this photo. For this you can use <a href="http://makemoneyadultcontent.com/snagit-software-full-review/" target="_blank">Snagit software</a> or Adobe Photoshop. On the image you have to write, <em><strong>&#8220;Best HD (niche primary keyword) videos only at (website name) updated regularly)</strong></em> . The final image should look something like this:</p><p><a href="http://makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/before-after-video-free-traffic.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-305" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=" data-lazy-src="http://makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/before-after-video-free-traffic.jpg" alt="before after video free traffic" width="1098" height="607" data-lazy-srcset="http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/before-after-video-free-traffic.jpg 1098w, http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/before-after-video-free-traffic-300x166.jpg 300w, http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/before-after-video-free-traffic-1024x566.jpg 1024w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 1098px) 100vw, 1098px"/><noscript><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-305" src="http://makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/before-after-video-free-traffic.jpg" alt="before after video free traffic" width="1098" height="607" srcset="http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/before-after-video-free-traffic.jpg 1098w, http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/before-after-video-free-traffic-300x166.jpg 300w, http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/before-after-video-free-traffic-1024x566.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1098px) 100vw, 1098px"/></noscript></a></p><p>Using Adobe Premiere Pro, i add this image at the start and end of video for five seconds each. Also quickly create a logo for your website using Adobe Photoshop or any other software and add this logo at the corner of your videos. After adding all this branding export the videos from Adobe Premier Pro software</p><h3>Automate Premiere Pro export</h3><p>If you are following my How to <a href="../my-journey-to-3500-per-month-from-adult-tube-websites/index.html" target="_blank">Make $3500 per month from adult tube websites</a> guide, then this article on <strong>Automate Premiere Pro export </strong>will help you a lot.</p><p>Automation is loved by all.

Earlier if i had to edit and export lets say 20 clips, then i was first editing the first clip and then waiting for its export so that i can work on my second clip.

So instead of waiting for each video to get rendered and exported, you can queue them up and check back later.

Although not all websites, but some of these adult tube websites allow you to include your website name in the title of the video. (for eg: xvideos.com allows it) i want you to include your websites home page url at the end of the title of your video. For example if the title of your video is &#8220;best foot fetish video&#8221; change it to &#8220;best foot fetish video &#8211; www.yoursitename.com&#8221;</p><h2>Build Adult traffic &#8211; Smart and Innovative ways</h2><p>Building adult traffic for your adult website might seem extremely difficult as first. If you have been following my website for long then you probably already know the best working methods to drive insane adult traffic to your adult site. My personal favorite is <a href="../advanced-guide-adult-seo-backlinks/index.html" target="_blank">Adult seo </a> and i have written a comprehensive guide on that topic, do check it out</p><p>Today i will be sharing with you methods of driving adult visitors that are not conventional. Do not expect them to drive enormous amount of visitors to your adult site, but they will definitely help you increase your overall traffic. So lets start:</p><h3><strong><img class="size-full wp-image-3259 alignleft" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=" data-lazy-src="http://makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-08-14_18-06-57.png" alt="Build Adult traffic - Smart and Innovative ways disqus" width="260" height="185"/><noscript><img class="size-full wp-image-3259 alignleft" src="http://makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-08-14_18-06-57.png" alt="Build Adult traffic - Smart and Innovative ways disqus" width="260" height="185"/></noscript>Disqus Comments</strong></h3><p>It is an excellent way to drive user engagement on your website as well as drive additional traffic. Disqus is by far  the most common commenting system on the internet. They proudly pronounce themselves as a company that helps increase website traffic and trust me they are not lying, I have been using disqus comments for almost all my adult sites and it has really solved the need of a great commenting system while also driving additional traffic. (Even on this website I use Disqus comments)</p><p><strong>How can Disqus comments helps your adult website?</strong></p><p>I use my domain name as my Disqus name, this helps in more exposure</p><p>Since disqus is very popular you can easily find relevant blogs in your niche and add relevant helpful comments on multiple ares, and this drives targeted traffic back to your websites</p><p>Links in Disqus comments are &#8220;nofollow&#8221; so do not think this will help you in link building and link juice for adult search engine optimization but it will definitely help in building nofollow links that will improve overall trust factor of the website</p><p>They also show relevant internal articles along with each post, hence Pages/visit metric increases.</p><h3><strong>Traffic trading</strong></h3><p>If i am interested in making money online, then probably i am visiting multiple websites adn blogs in that niche. This is how you as an owner of adult website/porn site can leverage to drive more traffic. Make a list of all the websites that are relevant to your niche, and also add the contact information of each websites (Contact form URL or direst Email address , if you can find it)</p><p>Start sending them personalized email about trading traffic by putting each others link on both websites. This will help in driving targeted relevant traffic between both websites and benefits all. I have seen that not many websites owners say no to this, because it is helping them as well. Just make sure to not target the giants in your niche, because most probably they wont reply back to you. Try to find websites with similar traffic stats. For finding traffic estimations of any website, use <a href="http://similarweb.com/">Similarweb</a> , it gives the most accurate traffic estimates of any website.</p><p>The best part about this technique is that you will also get the backlink from a relevant niche website which will enormously help in adult seo of your website. If the link is nofollow then it will help in improving trust flow of your website, if the link is follow then good for you</p><p>You can also apply the same technique for Twitter as well, find twitter handles that are relevant to your niche and then ask them for shutouts trading. You can leverage and promote each other and trade the followers</p><h3><strong>Watermarking and then promoting yoru websites</strong></h3><p>Watermarking your content is a great way of driving highly targeted <a href="http://makemoneyadultcontent.com/type-in-adult-traffic-for-adult-sites-and-webmasters/">direct (type-in) adult traffic </a>. This also helps in leveraging websites and people who steal your content, by getting some of those visitors back to the original websites. If you are a webcam model, just watermark your pics and videos with your website domain name, or twitter handle if you want that.</p><p>If you are a clipstore owner or even any adult performer (camgirl, webcam models etc) then you can easily share trailers of your clips or videos after watermarking them on various tube sites, twitter Facebook etc. This will help drive those people to your website that just found your video and were interested in knowing more about you. Without the watermark they will just watch the videos and will have no clue about finding you.</p><p>You can even watermark your images and post it on porn pinning sites (example sex.com) to drive targeted traffic</p><p>These are all the four steps you have to follow to drive huge traffic towards your website from already established adult tube websites.</p><h2>Building adult traffic the right way &#8211; Complete guide</h2><p>Traffic is king. The more the traffic, the more money you will make. Before seeing any positive results as an adult website owner, you need targeted adult traffic. One of the most asked question to me (through email, fb messages and comments on the website) are:</p><p><img class="size-full wp-image-1750 alignright" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=" data-lazy-src="http://makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/2016-05-14_16-24-12.png" alt="Building adult traffic " width="259" height="174" data-lazy-srcset="http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/2016-05-14_16-24-12.png 259w, http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/2016-05-14_16-24-12-110x75.png 110w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 259px) 100vw, 259px"/><noscript><img class="size-full wp-image-1750 alignright" src="http://makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/2016-05-14_16-24-12.png" alt="Building adult traffic " width="259" height="174" srcset="http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/2016-05-14_16-24-12.png 259w, http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/2016-05-14_16-24-12-110x75.png 110w" sizes="(max-width: 259px) 100vw, 259px"/></noscript></p><ol><li>how to generate adult audience.</li><li>How to get adult traffic</li><li>How to build an adult audience?</li><li>How to increase my adult following?</li></ol><p>One of the biggest problem I find is that people expect that they will do one thing and thousands of targeted adult traffic visitors will start coming on their website. (although through paid advertising you can achieve that). There is no secret trick to generate adult traffic within days. Building adult audience/traffic/following for your website will take time. You need to be patient. Now that I have mentioned tis very important fact, now let’s move on the tactics/methods you can deploy to drive more traffic to your adult website</p><p><strong>Quality is everything</strong></p><p>People think that they will follow get rich quick guide and they will become millionaire. It doesn’t work that way. The one rule that I have learned over the years is that you will first have to provide value to other, in order to be successful. Whenever someone visits your website they must be astonished. They must be so happy with the quality of the content that they decide to become an active reader, share your content, email you, post comments and become genuine fans</p><p>Keep the quality of your content to 1000%. Yes, quality is everything. Find your differentiating factor.</p><p>Even if you succeed in driving thousands of visitors to your website, but if the content is not up to the mark, they will never come back.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Leverage embedding and content of others</strong></p><p>You don’t have to become a content producer in order to make money. You can become and affiliate to sell other products. Similarly, you can use content on other website to drive traffic to your website. In my $3500 per month guide (add link), I give you a step-by-steno guide on making amazing passive income through tube website with minimum cost. If you start uploading your own videos, then it will take a toll on your time and bandwidth. Rather I ask you to embed the videos from other major tube websites such as (videos, pornhub etc.). This way you are utilizing the expensive servers of other major companies to benefit you.</p><p>Note: Please note that never ever use content that you do not own copyright to. Makemoneyadultcontent.com never advise that to its visitor. You must have the consent of the party whose content you are icing</p><p><strong>There are numerous ways of adding content to your website</strong></p><ol><li>If you are tube website owner then you can embed the videos from popular tube websites</li><li>If you are a clipstore model, then you can create a website for you showcasing all the things you do, videos you produced, camshows you participate in, etc. More like an aggregator of all the adult services you provide. Similarly, you can do the same if you are a webcam model.</li><li>You can create an adult blog on any adult niche and add relevant articles</li><li>Many more ways of starting an adult website, check out other articles on our website for more knowledge and information</li></ol><p><strong>Promoting your website and content for adult traffic and building an adult audience</strong></p><p>Promotion is the trickiest part. People already spend a lot of time building the content of their adult website, and when it comes to promotion they become lazy. (honestly I am also like that). Understand one thing, even if you have the most amazing content in the world, but if people cannot find you then you will never ever make money.</p><p>Dedicate time for promotion and marketing of your website. There are multiple ways of driving traffic:</p><ol><li>Search Engine Optimization or <a href="../advanced-guide-adult-seo-backlinks/index.html">Adult SEO guide</a></li><li>Social Media</li><li>Direct traffic</li><li>Traffic trades</li></ol><p>I have written detailed articles on all of these methods of adult traffic generation, do check them out</p><p>If you are not creating a tube website, then I will highly recommend you to indulge in Lead generation. Capturing email ids of your website visitors is a must if you want to be successful online. You don’t want the visitor to come, get the information and leave. To make them loyal followers, you will need their email ids, so that you can build a relationship with them over the email.</p><p>Keep adding value to them through email, so that soon they will become regular and loyal fans and then you can sell them the products that will make you money. Smart people never depend on advertising income for making money, they create and sell products.</p><p>Building adult traffic is not tough, but it will take some time and smart decisions</p><p><strong>Why I don’t like display advertisements</strong></p><p>If you will notice on this website, then you will realize that I do not have a singe banner advertisement. The reason is simple; I do not really care about those few dollars. Why would I drive my visitors to some other website, when I can drive them to my other articles, so that they read more and more The more they read, the more they will like my content. This helps in building a stronger relationship and hence a community of people who want to make money in adult niche. This community is what I am looking for. Instead of placing Ad-banners, I have banners of my own articles directing them to that content.</p><p>You goal is to make your visitors fall in love with you and your website. This will make them begging for more, and they will become repeat visitors.</p><p>Try to give them as much love as possible. Add value in their life, and soon they will help you make money through your website.

As an affiliate everyone tries to find the best and high converting traffic for their affiliate product/service/offer. To generate this traffic there are three ways on the internet:</p><ol><li>White hat methods</li><li>Black Hat methods</li><li>Grey hat methods</li></ol><p>Let&#8217;s talk about this one by one.</p><h3><strong>White hat methods for generating traffic for Affiliate marketing</strong></h3><p>These are legally accepted methods that most of the affiliates use to drive conversions. Methods like <a href="../make-1000-day-adult-media-buying-guide-step-step/index.html">Adult media buying </a>, <a href="../advanced-guide-adult-seo-backlinks/index.html">Adult SEO</a> are few examples. Since these methods are legal and also targeting is done correctly they give a long-term benefit. Also getting conversions through them is acceptable and also beneficial for advertisers and people with affiliate products or services</p><h3><strong>Black hat methods for generating traffic for Affiliate marketing</strong></h3><p>There are underground illegal ways that many use to cheat the system. These are unethical ways deployed by some crooked souls to make quick cash at the expense of someone else loss. Using black hat methods advertisers lose money and people using black hat methods come under the purview of law if caught</p><p>These methods only give short-term gains and wont give you a steady passive income in a long-term scenario.</p><h3><strong>Grey hat methods for generating traffic for Affiliate marketing</strong></h3><p>Among the two extreme world lie another world known as &#8220;grey hat&#8221;. In this, there are techniques and methods to generate traffic that are not strictly blackhat and neither Whitehat. Black hat methods are strictly banned by all affiliate networks because they care about their advertisers. White hat methods are loved by all.However adult affiliate websites also allow Grey hat methods as they somewhat legal and also leads to genuine conversions.</p><p>Since out topic in hand today is Grey hat methods, so lets talk about them in detail</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOTE:</span> important Note before using any of these methods</strong></p><p>Many affiliate networks or affiliate programs do not allow grey hat methods of traffic to their affiliate offer so please do check the TOS before using any one of these. If you get banned or your CPA account gets terminated because fo this then i shall not be deemed liable. These methods are not strictly acceptable  and hence you must take action at your own risk</p><h3><strong>Keyword spamming</strong></h3><p>One of the most popular methods use to get your articles and post indexed in Google is Keyword spamming. Although with recent many algorithm updates many website have been hit badly with the penalty but i can still see many websites  (websites like watching movies online, adult tube websites etc) still flourishing with their keyword stuffing techniques</p><h3><strong>Content spinning</strong></h3><p>This is a very popular technique sued by people to drive target organic traffic to their website. To get organic content or content from search engines, you need to add high quality original content regularly on your website. But doing this requires time and effort. To bypass this, people started using content spinning softwares tha changes the words, phrases, sentences in such a way that Google thinks that the content is original</p><p>Since Google is tricked into believing this, and hence they don&#8217;t penalize this website for stolen content. If you have gone through my How to Make $3500 per month from adult tube websites  guide then one major part of driving organic traffic is changing wordings of Adult tube video title</p><h3><strong>Redirects</strong></h3><p>Redirection is when someone is sent to a url &#8220;abc.com&#8221; and when he reaches there instead of opening &#8220;abc.com&#8221; it gets redirected to some other url lets say &#8220;def.com&#8221;. It is also called domain redirection and can easily be done using a WordPress plugin or even from the backend of your hosting provider</p><h3><strong>Buying backlinks for Adult SEO</strong></h3><p>Everyone wants high quality targeted traffic to their website. For this you need to invest in Adult SEO of your website. This requires time and a lot of work as adding great content and building high quality relevant backlinks requires a lot of effort</p><p>To bypass this effort some adult webmaster resort to paying other high quality website owners (who are in the same niche) to buy backlinks in exchange of money. although google does not like tis method but it is extremely difficult for them to find out whether the backlink is paid or not. So find some high quality niche focused website and pay money to get your website ro service listed there</p><h3><strong>Creating PBN or private blog networks</strong></h3><p>If you have ever hired a SEO agency or any other SEO company for your website then you might have heard of PBN&#8217;s or private blog networks. These are hundreds of websites owned by these companies that are used to build easy and quick back links for the clients website. Use of PBN requires a lot of expertise and knowledge as one wrong move can lead to a penalty from Google which will have drastic consequences on your organic traffic</p><h3><strong>Comment spamming</strong></h3><p>There are many softwares that can be used to do comment spamming. Many people use such softwares to automate their comment spamming so that they can drive traffic to their affiliate offer if the comment is visible to the website visitors</p><h3><strong>Promoting adult content on Mainstream social media</strong></h3><p>Not all social media giants like Facebook are adult friendly. Most of them do not allow posting of adult content and will ban your account if you do so. If you are into adult affiliate marketing it becomes extremely difficult for you to generate traffic for your adult affiliate offer.</p><p>Although there are many ways and workarounds for using adult content on social media sites and i will be writing an article about this very soon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Adult porn tube websites to submit videos for traffic</h2><p><em><b>Legal disclaimer:</b> This article is for information only.

I have been using the same method for almost 4 years now.</p><p>This is by far the best way to drive traffic to your website. I have been getting amazing results . The best part is people searches on google and then visit your website, so this will easily give you google rankings as well.</p><p>The only issue with this method is Copyright infringement of videos. You account might get banned, you videos might get deleted, but you can easily drive traffic to your adult website through this method.</p><p>If i have to choose one method then this will be it. If you can focus on this method alone then you wont need to follow other 8 ways (apart from<a href="../advanced-guide-adult-seo-backlinks/index.html" target="_blank"> Adult SEO steps</a>) , to drive adult traffic to your website.</p><p><strong>2. <a href="../advanced-guide-adult-seo-backlinks/index.html" target="_blank">Adult SEO complete guide</a></strong></p><p>My only goal in any website is targeting Google.

Facebook and Twitter</strong></p><p>I follow this method just to get the social proof of the website. If you have a tube website then social proof will help you in getting google rankings.</p><p>Although both of these platforms do not allow adult content, but there are ways you can do that.</p><p>For Facebook you can post in adult groups by joining them first. You can even make Facebook pages of hot models and then promote affiliate products (like camming check out our <a href="../crakrevenue-review-and-payment-proof/index.html" target="_blank">Crakrevenue Review and Payment proof</a> ). Hot girls easily get friend request and soon you will have a following, then you can promote your offer and make money off it. <strong>Note:</strong> Do not post naked/nude pics or you will be banned. Facebook is a good way to drive adult traffic to your website, but the traffic is very less so i do not recommend it if you are looking only for traffic.</p><p>For Twitter:  There are many different ways to make money of Twitter. Choosing the right HasgTags is very important. Build a following by tweeting regularly and using hashtags relevant to your niche.</p><p>For both Facebook and twitter, targeting the audience related to your niche is critical. Otherwise you will have high bounce rate and all your hard-work will amount to nothing.</p><p><strong>4. Tumblr</strong></p><p>Tumblr is a great way to drive good amount of traffic to your website.

Stumbleupon and Reddit</strong></p><p>You should make it a habit of submitting your content of Stumbleupon and Reddit. This in turn will drive targeted traffic to your website. Giving a good catchy title is very important.</p><p>I personally like Reddit. First find the subreddit of your niche and then post links of your website. Note: Reddit has strict policy against spammers so do not spam rather become an active contributor. The Direct targeted traffic will give a good jump to your website traffic.</p><p><strong>6. The most important way</strong></p><p>Focus on above five methods only. Trust me on that, i can give you 20 more ways to drive traffic but that will be information overload for you and in the end you will do nothing.

The target being getting featured on the home page or rank higher for certain keywords. Yes you read that right, it will be like video optimization for adult tubes.</p><p><em><strong>So how does this method work. ?</strong></em></p><p>Popular adult tube websites get tons of traffic, and we will be targeting to get a small pie of that free adult traffic. I will be using popular adult tube website “Xvideos” as an example. Every uploaded video has a “thumbs up” and “thumbs down” option just like youtube has “like and dislike”.</p><p>Load “Fiddler” or any other HTTP Analyzer (For ex: LiveHTTPHeaders for Firefox) and then press the thumbs of button for one of your video.</p><p>You will be given a new link which looks something like this:</p><p><em>Xvideos.com/videovote/11148569/YES/1100011001101100110010100100111061115/?_=1434857696874</em></p><p>Now as we are embedding the videos that we upload on our website. We embed the videos by copying the iframe embed code. Which looks like</p><p><em>&lt;iframe src=&#8221;http://flashservice.xvideos.com/embedframe/12142271&#8243; frameborder=0 width=510 height=400 scrolling=no&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</em></p><p>Now after you have embedded your video, just below that embed code copy the same embed code with some changes. Here are the list of changes</p><ul><li>Replace “://flashservice.xvideos.com/embedframe/12142271” with the link you obtained above</li><li>Change the value of height and width to zero “width=0 height=0”</li></ul><p>After your video starts getting some views on your website, every visitor that watches the video on your website, will automatically make a “thumbs up”. This will help in boosting the rating of the video on Xvideos and helping it rank higher.</p><p>Apart from xvideos, this method works on many other websites as well. This method can help you Drive enormous free traffic from adult tube websites</p><h2>Adult Traffic Infographic</h2><p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3035" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=" data-lazy-src="http://makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Adult-Traffic-Sources.png" alt="Adult Traffic Infographic" width="800" height="2000" data-lazy-srcset="http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Adult-Traffic-Sources.png 800w, http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Adult-Traffic-Sources-120x300.png 120w, http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Adult-Traffic-Sources-410x1024.png 410w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"/><noscript><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3035" src="http://makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Adult-Traffic-Sources.png" alt="Adult Traffic Infographic" width="800" height="2000" srcset="http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Adult-Traffic-Sources.png 800w, http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Adult-Traffic-Sources-120x300.png 120w, http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Adult-Traffic-Sources-410x1024.png 410w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"/></noscript></p><p>Adult Traffic Infographic is an overview of how you can drive enormous targeted traffic to your adult website.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If i missed some point or you were not able to understand something, please share your query in the comments section below.

Today i will tell you How to get Free Unlimited direct traffic for adult tube website\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/makemoneyadult\/status\/721304734083059713\r\n\r\nThese technique will help anyone in the following adult industry:\r\n\r\n \tAdult blogs or Porn Blogs (just like mine)\r\n \tAdult tube website (This technique works best for adult tube sites)\r\n \tAdult service (Adult games,\r\n \tPremium adult websites (Like Brazzers, where you charge for porn clips)\r\n \tAdult Forums\r\n \tAdult Video hosting websites\r\n \tAdult image hosting websites\r\n \tCam sites\r\n \tAdult Affiliate sites (dating websites)\r\n \tAdult chat sites\r\n \tAdult online shops\r\n \tEscort sites\r\n\r\nAlthough i am strictly pro-free traffic, i mean free organic traffic from Google. For that i have already told you many techniques :\u00a0Read our Adult SEO Article\u00a0for some amazing ways and tricks to get you website ranked on Google\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut any free traffic is welcomed by a website owner. Today i will tell you a goldmine of free niche focused adult traffic. For this we will be using famous adult tube websites (like Redtube, Xvideos etc). I have listed down the key steps we will be following in this whole process and then i will explain each one of it:\r\n\r\n \tDownload niche specific videos\r\n \tEdit the video to add branding of your website\r\n \tUpload the video on leading tube websites (Read this to make this process super easy: Advanced Video Submitter full review for adult tube website)\r\n \tSettings, title, tags and description of each video\r\n\r\nBefore moving forward i would request you to install ANT video downloader in Mozilla. This is an amazing plugin which i have been using since four years now to download the best videos from various website that are related to the niche of my adult tube website. After installing this plugin, the moment any video starts playing you can download it by clicking on the button on your toolbar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLets start with step 1. Download niche specific videos\r\n\r\nWhere shall i find the the best videos related to my niche. For this you can start by searching for a similar tube website which is focused on the same niche as yours and then downloading the popular videos from that website.\r\n\r\nOR you can visit popular tube websites and then after searching for the keywords of your niche, downloading the high quality Popular videos with many likes\r\n\r\n(NOTE: Check our RESOURCES page to learn all the tools and websites i use to make more than $5,000 per month. Majority of them are free and you can acheive the same results if you follow my advice)\r\n\r\nOR you can find the key companies in the niche of your website which make videos and sell them or subscription based model. Then search for the torrents or download links of those videos and downloading those videos.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nLets start with step 2. Edit the video to add branding of your website\r\n\r\nThe videos you download using Ant video downloader plugin will be in .FLV format. I use Adobe Premiere Pro to edit my videos but sadly it does not allow .flv videos to be edited and hence i use a video converter software named as \"Total video converter\" for converting my videos from .flv to .wmv. If you have any other Video editor which allows .flv videos to be edited then you do not need this extra step of converting the videos from .flv to .mp4 or .wmv.\r\n\r\nFirst of off let me tell you the kind of branding that we will be adding to the video\r\n\r\n \tA five second image before the start of video\r\n \tA five second Image at the end of Video\r\n \tOur website logo throughout entire video length at one of the corners\r\n\r\nHow to select the image?\r\n\r\nFor this all you have to do is go to Google images and search the primary keyword of your niche and adding the word \"wallpaper\" with it. For example if your niche is foot fetish, then on Google image search use the query \"Foot fetish wallpaper\" and then download a high definition photo which relates to your niche.\r\n\r\nNow we have to edit this photo to add some text on this photo. For this you can use Snagit software or Adobe Photoshop. On the image you have to write, \"Best HD (niche primary keyword) videos only at (website name) updated regularly) . The final image should look something like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing Adobe Premiere Pro, i add this image at the start and end of video for five seconds each. Also quickly create a logo for your website using Adobe Photoshop or any other software and add this logo at the corner of your videos.

This required my constant attention and a lot of time and energy was spent.\r\n\r\nThen i came across this amazing video which showed how you can edit all the videos at once and then queue them up for exporting later. So instead of waiting for each video to get rendered and exported, you can queue them up and check back later. Here is the video:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAll you need in extra is Adobe Media Encoder. Install it. And when you are exporting the video by going to File --&gt;Export --&gt; Media or by keyboard shortcut Cntrl + M, instead of clicking export, click on Queue.\r\n\r\nAnd then one by one you can edit the videos and queue them without waiting for exports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask me in comments section below.\r\n\r\nLets start with step 3.

Give time to write relevant tags and small description describing the scene and the pornstar name in the video.\r\n\r\nTIP: Here is a great tip to drive more traffic. Although not all websites, but some of these adult tube websites allow you to include your website name in the title of the video. (for eg: xvideos.com allows it) i want you to include your websites home page url at the end of the title of your video. For example if the title of your video is \"best foot fetish video\" change it to \"best foot fetish video - www.yoursitename.com\"\r\nBuild Adult traffic - Smart and Innovative ways\r\nBuilding adult traffic for your adult website might seem extremely difficult as first. If you have been following my website for long then you probably already know the best working methods to drive insane adult traffic to your adult site. My personal favorite is Adult seo \u00a0and i have written a comprehensive guide on that topic, do check it out\r\n\r\nToday i will be sharing with you methods of driving adult visitors that are not conventional. Do not expect them to drive enormous amount of visitors to your adult site, but they will definitely help you increase your overall traffic. So lets start:\r\nDisqus Comments\r\nIt is an excellent way to drive user engagement on your website as well as drive additional traffic. Disqus is by far \u00a0the most common commenting system on the internet. They proudly pronounce themselves as a company that helps increase website traffic and trust me they are not lying, I have been using disqus comments for almost all my adult sites and it has really solved the need of a great commenting system while also driving additional traffic. (Even on this website I use Disqus comments)\r\n\r\nHow can Disqus comments helps your adult website?\r\n\r\nI use my domain name as my Disqus name, this helps in more exposure\r\n\r\nSince disqus is very popular you can easily find relevant blogs in your niche and add relevant helpful comments on multiple ares, and this drives targeted traffic back to your websites\r\n\r\nLinks in Disqus comments are \"nofollow\" so do not think this will help you in link building and link juice for adult search engine optimization but it will definitely help in building nofollow links that will improve overall trust factor of the website\r\n\r\nThey also show relevant internal articles along with each post, hence Pages\/visit metric increases.\r\nTraffic trading\r\nIf i am interested in making money online, then probably i am visiting multiple websites adn blogs in that niche. This is how you as an owner of adult website\/porn site can leverage to drive more traffic. Make a list of all the websites that are relevant to your niche, and also add the contact information of each websites (Contact form URL or direst Email address , if you can find it)\r\n\r\nStart sending them personalized email about trading traffic by putting each others link on both websites. This will help in driving targeted relevant traffic between both websites and benefits all. I have seen that not many websites owners say no to this, because it is helping them as well. Just make sure to not target the giants in your niche, because most probably they wont reply back to you. Try to find websites with similar traffic stats. For finding traffic estimations of any website, use Similarweb\u00a0, it gives the most accurate traffic estimates of any website.\r\n\r\nThe best part about this technique is that you will also get the backlink\u00a0from a relevant niche website which will enormously help in adult seo of your website. If the link is nofollow then it will help in improving trust flow of your website, if the link is follow then good for you\r\n\r\nYou can also apply the same technique for Twitter as well, find twitter handles that are relevant to your niche and then ask them for shutouts trading. You can leverage and promote each other and trade the followers\r\nWatermarking and then promoting yoru websites\r\nWatermarking your content is a great way of driving highly targeted direct (type-in) adult traffic . This also helps in leveraging websites and people who steal your content, by getting some of those visitors back to the original websites. If you are a webcam model, just watermark your pics and videos with your website domain name, or twitter handle if you want that.\r\n\r\nIf you are a clipstore owner or even any adult performer (camgirl, webcam models etc) then you can easily share trailers of your clips or videos after watermarking them on various tube sites, twitter Facebook etc. This will help drive those people to your website that just found your video and were interested in knowing more about you. Without the watermark they will just watch the videos and will have no clue about finding you.\r\n\r\nYou can even watermark your images and post it on porn pinning sites (example sex.com) to drive targeted traffic\r\n\r\nThese are all the four steps you have to follow to drive huge traffic towards your website from already established adult tube websites.\r\nBuilding adult traffic the right way - Complete guide\r\nTraffic is king. The more the traffic, the more money you will make. Before seeing any positive results as an adult website owner, you need targeted adult traffic. One of the most asked question to me (through email, fb messages and comments on the website) are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \thow to generate adult audience.\r\n \tHow to get adult traffic\r\n \tHow to build an adult audience?\r\n \tHow to increase my adult following?\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest problem I find is that people expect that they will do one thing and thousands of targeted adult traffic visitors will start coming on their website. (although through paid advertising you can achieve that). There is no secret trick to generate adult traffic within days. Building adult audience\/traffic\/following for your website will take time. You need to be patient. Now that I have mentioned tis very important fact, now let\u2019s move on the tactics\/methods you can deploy to drive more traffic to your adult website\r\n\r\nQuality is everything\r\n\r\nPeople think that they will follow get rich quick guide and they will become millionaire. It doesn\u2019t work that way. The one rule that I have learned over the years is that you will first have to provide value to other, in order to be successful. Whenever someone visits your website they must be astonished. They must be so happy with the quality of the content that they decide to become an active reader, share your content, email you, post comments and become genuine fans\r\n\r\nKeep the quality of your content to 1000%. Yes, quality is everything. Find your differentiating factor.\r\n\r\nEven if you succeed in driving thousands of visitors to your website, but if the content is not up to the mark, they will never come back.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nLeverage embedding and content of others\r\n\r\nYou don\u2019t have to become a content producer in order to make money. You can become and affiliate to sell other products. Similarly, you can use content on other website to drive traffic to your website. In my $3500 per month guide (add link), I give you a step-by-steno guide on making amazing passive income through tube website with minimum cost. If you start uploading your own videos, then it will take a toll on your time and bandwidth. Rather I ask you to embed the videos from other major tube websites such as (videos, pornhub etc.). This way you are utilizing the expensive servers of other major companies to benefit you.\r\n\r\nNote: Please note that never ever use content that you do not own copyright to. Makemoneyadultcontent.com never advise that to its visitor. You must have the consent of the party whose content you are icing\r\n\r\nThere are numerous ways of adding content to your website\r\n\r\n \tIf you are tube website owner then you can embed the videos from popular tube websites\r\n \tIf you are a clipstore model, then you can create a website for you showcasing all the things you do, videos you produced, camshows you participate in, etc. More like an aggregator of all the adult services you provide. Similarly, you can do the same if you are a webcam model.\r\n \tYou can create an adult blog on any adult niche and add relevant articles\r\n \tMany more ways of starting an adult website, check out other articles on our website for more knowledge and information\r\n\r\nPromoting your website and content for adult traffic and building an adult audience\r\n\r\nPromotion is the trickiest part. People already spend a lot of time building the content of their adult website, and when it comes to promotion they become lazy. (honestly I am also like that). Understand one thing, even if you have the most amazing content in the world, but if people cannot find you then you will never ever make money.\r\n\r\nDedicate time for promotion and marketing of your website. There are multiple ways of driving traffic:\r\n\r\n \tSearch Engine Optimization or Adult SEO guide\r\n \tSocial Media\r\n \tDirect traffic\r\n \tTraffic trades\r\n\r\nI have written detailed articles on all of these methods of adult traffic generation, do check them out\r\n\r\nIf you are not creating a tube website, then I will highly recommend you to indulge in Lead generation. Capturing email ids of your website visitors is a must if you want to be successful online. You don\u2019t want the visitor to come, get the information and leave. To make them loyal followers, you will need their email ids, so that you can build a relationship with them over the email.\r\n\r\nKeep adding value to them through email, so that soon they will become regular and loyal fans and then you can sell them the products that will make you money. Smart people never depend on advertising income for making money, they create and sell products.\r\n\r\nBuilding adult traffic is not tough, but it will take some time and smart decisions\r\n\r\nWhy I don\u2019t like display advertisements\r\n\r\nIf you will notice on this website, then you will realize that I do not have a singe banner advertisement. The reason is simple; I do not really care about those few dollars. Why would I drive my visitors to some other website, when I can drive them to my other articles, so that they read more and more The more they read, the more they will like my content. This helps in building a stronger relationship and hence a community of people who want to make money in adult niche. This community is what I am looking for. Instead of placing Ad-banners, I have banners of my own articles directing them to that content.\r\n\r\nYou goal is to make your visitors fall in love with you and your website. This will make them begging for more, and they will become repeat visitors.\r\n\r\nTry to give them as much love as possible. Add value in their life, and soon they will help you make money through your website. Remember shady methods of making money can give you instant pleasure, but a long term sustainable business is always build upon strong foundations.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nImage sharing websites for adult seo and free traffic\r\nIf you are lazy and are happy with the slow rise of traffic from google then it is fine, but if you are like me who wants to make money as fast as possible then investing some time on Image sharing websites for adult seo and free adult traffic will be really helpful.\r\n\r\nSo where can i find a list of image sharing websites you ask, don't worry i already have that covered. Here are the major adult image sharing websites:\r\n\r\n \timgur.com\/adult\r\n \t9gag.com\/nsfw\r\n \t4 chan\r\n \tTheFapp\r\n \tBustybay\r\n \tFapstr\r\n \tFappyness\r\n \tNSFWR\r\n \tFuskator\r\n \tHelloKisses\r\n \tShePoses\r\n \tfaplr\r\n \tPicleecher\r\n \tDumpomaat\r\n \tNSFWJPG\r\n \tPhapit\r\n \tGrazzier\r\n \tPost-Tits\r\n \tApinaPorn\r\n \tI-Like-NSFW\r\n \tShuttur\r\n \tSubimg\r\n \tWeLuvPorn\r\n \tAssPictures\r\n \tSexyGorgeousWomen\r\n \tSmoder\r\n \tSexit\r\n \tTehGirrafe\r\n \tBootyOfTheDay\r\n\r\nAll you have to do is Watermark Adult Pics in the niche of your website and Upload them to these popular image sharing sites . Some websites also offer a place to put your link which can be really helpful in making backlinks.\r\nIncrease Adult traffic through Google image search\r\nRanking a adult website is getting tougher by the day. Google is making extremely difficult for adult website to rank higher is Google search results. In general, it is already difficult to do Adult Seo and make Adult Backlinks , compared to non-adult websites.. Today i will tell you about how to Increase Adult traffic through Google image search\r\nThis is the reason adult webmasters have to think of innovative ways to drive traffic to their websites. One such avenue of traffic is Google image search. People looking for adult content have a tendency to do a higher number of Google image search compared to a non-adult website, this is because of the graphic nature of adult websites.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhat is adult seo for your images?\r\n\r\nSEO for images is done through \"ALT\" text. These tags are like giving Google a brief description about your image. So whether you are operating a adult tube website, or working on a article based adult website, adding few images with relevant alt text\u00a0 can help you a lot in capturing image based traffic.\r\n\r\nSo how to do adult seo for your images, or how to add alt text?\r\n\r\n\r\nAdding ALT text\u00a0 for your adult images is very simple. Whenever you add an image from your wordpress \"Add Media\" section and upload an image, you get an option to put the following information for your image:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the highlighted , \"Alt Text\", add the keyword you are targeting to rank for. You can also add the title of your post or article.\r\n\r\nTIP: If you have a adult tube website, then adding the Alt text in the featured image can also help a lot.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nGenerate enormous adult traffic - Affiliate marketing - White\/Black\/Grey hat methods\r\nGenerating converting traffic is the core of Affiliate marketing. As an affiliate everyone tries to find the best and high converting traffic for their affiliate product\/service\/offer. To generate this traffic there are three ways on the internet:\r\n\r\n \tWhite hat methods\r\n \tBlack Hat methods\r\n \tGrey hat methods\r\n\r\nLet's talk about this one by one.\r\nWhite hat methods for generating traffic for Affiliate marketing\r\nThese are legally accepted methods that most of the affiliates use to drive conversions. Methods like Adult media buying\u00a0, Adult SEO\u00a0are few examples. Since these methods are legal and also targeting is done correctly\u00a0they give a long-term benefit. Also getting conversions through them is acceptable and also beneficial for advertisers and people with affiliate products or services\r\nBlack hat methods for generating traffic for Affiliate marketing\r\nThere are underground illegal ways that many use to cheat the system. These are unethical ways deployed by some crooked souls to make quick cash at the expense of someone else loss. Using black hat methods advertisers lose money and people using black hat methods come under the purview\u00a0of law if caught\r\n\r\nThese methods only give short-term gains and wont give you a steady passive income in a long-term scenario.\r\nGrey\u00a0hat methods for generating traffic for Affiliate marketing\r\nAmong the two extreme world lie another world known as \"grey hat\". In this, there are techniques and methods to generate traffic that are not strictly blackhat and neither Whitehat. Black hat methods are strictly banned by all affiliate networks because they care about their advertisers. White hat methods are loved by all.However adult affiliate websites also allow Grey hat methods as they somewhat legal and also leads to genuine conversions.\r\n\r\nSince out topic in hand today is Grey hat methods, so lets talk about them in detail\r\n\r\nNOTE: important Note before using any of these methods\r\n\r\nMany affiliate networks or affiliate programs do not allow grey hat methods of traffic to their affiliate offer so please do check the TOS before using any one of these. If you get banned or your CPA account gets terminated because fo this then i shall not be deemed liable. These methods are not strictly acceptable \u00a0and hence you must take action at your own risk\r\nKeyword spamming\r\nOne of the most popular methods use to get your articles and post indexed in Google is Keyword spamming. Although with recent many algorithm updates many website have been hit badly with the penalty but i can still see many websites \u00a0(websites like watching movies online, adult tube websites etc) still flourishing with their keyword stuffing techniques\r\nContent spinning\r\nThis is a very popular technique\u00a0sued by people to drive target organic traffic to their website. To get organic content or content from search engines, you need to add high quality original content regularly on your website. But doing this requires time and effort. To bypass this, people started using content spinning softwares tha changes the words, phrases, sentences in such a way that Google thinks that the content is original\r\n\r\nSince Google is tricked into believing this, and hence they don't penalize this website for stolen content. If you have gone through my How to Make $3500 per month from adult tube websites\u00a0 guide then one major part of driving organic traffic is changing wordings of Adult tube video title\r\nRedirects\r\nRedirection is when someone is sent to a url \"abc.com\" and when he reaches there instead of opening \"abc.com\" it gets redirected to some other url lets say \"def.com\". It is also called domain redirection and can easily be done using a WordPress plugin or even from the backend of your hosting provider\r\nBuying backlinks for Adult SEO\r\nEveryone wants high quality targeted traffic to their website. For this you need to invest in Adult SEO of your website. This requires time and a lot of work as adding great content and building high quality relevant backlinks requires a lot of effort\r\n\r\nTo bypass this effort some adult webmaster resort to paying other high quality website owners (who are in the same niche) to buy backlinks in exchange of money. although google does not like tis method but it is extremely difficult for them to find out whether the backlink is paid or not. So find some high quality niche focused website and pay money to get your website ro service listed there\r\nCreating PBN or private blog networks\r\nIf you have ever hired a SEO agency or any other SEO company for your website then you might have heard of PBN's or private blog networks. These are hundreds of websites owned by these companies that are used to build easy and quick back links for the clients website. Use of PBN requires a lot of expertise and knowledge as one wrong move can lead to a penalty from Google which will have drastic consequences on your organic traffic\r\nComment spamming\r\nThere are many softwares that can be used to do comment spamming. Many people use such softwares to automate their comment spamming so that they can drive traffic to their affiliate offer if the comment is visible to the website visitors\r\nPromoting adult content on Mainstream social media\r\nNot all social media giants like Facebook are adult friendly. Most of them do not allow posting of adult content and will ban your account if you do so. If you are into adult affiliate marketing it becomes extremely difficult for you to generate traffic for your\u00a0adult affiliate offer.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are many ways and workarounds for using adult content on social media sites and i will be writing an article about this very soon.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAdult porn tube websites to submit videos for traffic\r\nLegal disclaimer: This article is for information only.

I wrote an article about this\u00a0Make Adult backlinks using Link exchange website\r\n\r\nAlso if you have multiple websites, then you can interlink them to gain the maximum benefit from your visitors.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nTumblr Guide - Drive enormous adult traffic\r\nThe best part about Tumblr for adult webmasters is that it allows adult content. This allows adult website owners to make a following on Tumblr (people following your blogs) and then driving these visitors to your website. This in turn will help you make money through Tumblr.\r\n\r\nThe process is very simple, first set up your tumblr blog, gain following, grow your adult tumblr blog, and then make money through your adult tumblr blog.\r\n\r\nSetting up the blog in the perfect manner is important. Here is a screenshot of the correct working settings:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo not forget to turn on the \"Flag this blog as adult-oriented\" other wise you will be banned very soon.\r\n\r\nYou will also need to unlock adult content in tumblr to be able to see such content. To do this just search for any adult term and click on unlock button:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to get the initial boost you need on Tumblr:\r\n\r\nTo prevent the website from spammers and unethical people, tumblr does not show content of new blogs in its search results and other ways until you show your authenticity. People are too much focused on getting traffic that they end up posting hundreds of posts without thinking twice about being looked like a spammer. Just like Google hits you with a penalty if you do backlink spamming, similarly you have to be patient to Drive Tumblr traffic.\r\n\r\nThese are the steps you can follow:\r\n\r\n \tVerify your email address\r\n \tMake some changes in the appearance of your blog\r\n \tFollow few other blogs in your niche, post few pictures and videos\r\n \tReblog content of other blogs in your niche\r\n \tBe regular and do this for few days\r\n\r\nNote: These are not absolute steps that help you get featured in search results. This is what have been witnessed by me and other adult webmasters. Also Tumblr gives the following explanation for \" Why aren\/t my posts appearing on tag pages?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most effective way of gaining Tumblr Followers:\r\n\r\nIf you are someone who thinks spamming will easily help you gain thousands of tumblr followers overnight then you are wrong. Honestly i have been against spamming be it anywhere. I like to put in some extra effort so that quality is always\u00a0 above everything.\r\n\r\nYou will have to build a social proof. In in the initial days when you still trying to create a following on Tumblr, try to build relationship with the popular blogs in your niche. Keep in mind that content on your blog should be high quality for this to work. Try to comment on posts of other blogs (not spam but genuine comments), like their content, these owners of popular blogs will come to your website and when they see some quality content they will reblog your content. This will drive their audience to your website and thereby giving you a initial push that you want on tumblr. You aim to Drive tumblr traffic starts from here.\r\n\r\nOther way to Drive Tumblr traffic and gain\/get tumblr followers is following other people in your niche:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow-unfollow method has been used since long for people to gain twitter followers. Similar is the case here. According to a statistic, if you follow 1000 people then few of then will automatically follow you back.\r\n\r\nRemember here i am not talking about blogs in your niche, rather people who love the content in your niche -i.e you audience. Go to popular posts in your niche and look at the notes section. This is a list of people who loved that post. This is the perfect audience for your blog. These are the people you should follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to avoid being banned on Tumblr:\r\n\r\n \tFlag the blog as Adult\r\n \tDo not spam\r\n \tDont use advertisements on your tumblr blog, rather put links in your post description\r\n \tChange the image description, name etc. Using same description will get you banned\r\n \tFollow the TOS of tumblr\r\n \tDo not post illegal stuff\r\n \tDo not paste direct affiliate links, rather use a redirect\u00a0Hostgator Hosting with free domain name\r\n\r\nDrive Tumblr traffic and How to make money from Adult Tumblr Blogs:\r\n\r\nCrakrevenue is my choice of affiliate network for Making money through Adult tumblr blogs. Get your affiliate link and then put it in the image description. People will click the link and if you get few conversions, you can easily make easy money through tumblr adult blogs.\r\n\r\nUpdate: Do not paste direct blank affiliate links in image description of your tumblr blogs, rather buy a Hostgator Hosting with free domain name\u00a0and the redirect that domain name to your affiliate offer. This is the safest way of preventing your blog from getting banned\r\n\r\nThese tips will also help you if you are focused on How to get Traffic from Tumblr:\r\n\r\n \tMedia Type you post: You have many options, photos, text, videos, gifs etc. Try to post a balanced portfolio of such media types.\r\n \tMemes to the rescue: Posting funny memes really help in gaining a loyal audience and also help in getting repeat visitors. You can create them yourself or find few in your niche.\r\n \tBe generous with tags: Just like hastags in twitter and Instagram, tags in tumblr helps user find your blog. So add as many relevant tags as possible to every piece of content you post.\r\n \tBuild an amazing profile: Be thorough and authentic in your profile. Its the first thing a person will judge you upon before following you. So your first impression should be a killer one.\r\n \tBeing active is the Key: If you just create a business and do not invest time in it, it will never flourish. You have to treat it like your child and nurture it. Similarly, be regular and active with your blog. Add content daily and this will build a trust and following among your audience.\r\n \tDon't be shy and ignorant: Interact with your blogs audience. Comment on their post, reblog, and following them helps a lot.\r\n \tReblogging to the rescue: Reblogging other people content will provide your audience with a steady stream of fresh content while also giving you a chance of other people reblogging your stuff thereby driving more traffic. This benefits both party and helps in making authority. This is an important step so take this seriously.\r\n \tRiches in the niches: Everyone now knows that Google gives preference to blogs or website that are focused towards a niche. So choose one niche and build a authority blog on that niche. Niche blogs also have low bounce rate and high pageviews which in-turn help gaining better google rankings.\r\n \tQuality is everything: Just like you would not visit a site again if you did not like the content, similarly give high quality content to your audience and they will become fan for a very long time\r\n\r\n10 Methods to get\/drive free adult traffic\r\nThis guide of 10 ways free adult traffic will cover everything you need to learn about driving adult traffic to your adult website.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst lets understand the basis of adult traffic:\r\n\r\n \tPros: Easy to get because everyone loves adult content, they might not talk about it openly but secretly everyone is looking for adult content to satisfy their biological urges\r\n \tCons: Since adult content is questionable it becomes a little bit difficult to find websites that allow adult content, as well as in some websites you have the risk of getting banned if you do not follow their TOS.\r\n\r\nLets start with the list of 10 ways free adult traffic, drive thousands of visitors to your website.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \tTube Uploading\r\n\r\nOne of the easiest and fastest ways to drive enormous adult traffic to your adult website. I have been using the same method for almost 4 years now.\r\n\r\nThis is by far the best way to drive traffic to your website. I have been getting amazing results . The best part is people searches on google and then visit your website, so this will easily give you google rankings as well.\r\n\r\nThe only issue with this method is Copyright infringement of videos. You account might get banned, you videos might get deleted, but you can easily drive traffic to your adult website through this method.\r\n\r\nIf i have to choose one method then this will be it. If you can focus on this method alone then you wont need to follow other 8 ways (apart from Adult SEO steps) , to drive adult traffic to your website.\r\n\r\n2. Adult SEO complete guide\r\n\r\nMy only goal in any website is targeting Google. Getting good rankings so that once i reach a level (lets say 20,000 visitors per month), then i can make the website on autopilot and move onto some other project.\r\n\r\nAdult SEO is complicated and i cannot tell you all about it in just few lines. Trust me on this, your ultimate goal should be getting good rankings on Google and money will start pouring in easily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Facebook and Twitter\r\n\r\nI follow this method just to get the social proof of the website. If you have a tube website then social proof will help you in getting google rankings.\r\n\r\nAlthough both of these platforms do not allow adult content, but there are ways you can do that.\r\n\r\nFor Facebook you can post in adult groups by joining them first. You can even make Facebook pages of hot models and then promote affiliate products (like camming check out our Crakrevenue Review and Payment proof ). Hot girls easily get friend request and soon you will have a following, then you can promote your offer and make money off it. Note: Do not post naked\/nude pics or you will be banned. Facebook is a good way to drive adult traffic to your website, but the traffic is very less so i do not recommend it if you are looking only for traffic.\r\n\r\nFor Twitter:\u00a0 There are many different ways to make money of Twitter. Choosing the right HasgTags is very important. Build a following by tweeting regularly and using hashtags relevant to your niche.\r\n\r\nFor both Facebook and twitter, targeting the audience related to your niche is critical. Otherwise you will have high bounce rate and all your hard-work will amount to nothing.\r\n\r\n4. Tumblr\r\n\r\nTumblr is a great way to drive good amount of traffic to your website. I will soon be writing a detailed article on Making money as well as driving traffic through Tumblr.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Stumbleupon and Reddit\r\n\r\nYou should make it a habit of submitting your content of Stumbleupon and Reddit. This in turn will drive targeted traffic to your website. Giving a good catchy title is very important.\r\n\r\nI personally like Reddit. First find the subreddit of your niche and then post links of your website. Note: Reddit has strict policy against spammers so do not spam rather become an active contributor. The Direct targeted traffic will give a good jump to your website traffic.\r\n\r\n6. The most important way\r\n\r\nFocus on above five methods only. Trust me on that, i can give you 20 more ways to drive traffic but that will be information overload for you and in the end you will do nothing. After years of experience i have noticed that the above methods give the best results. So choose these methods\u00a0 and\u00a0 focus on them to drive results. This is the reason i am not writing about point number 7, 8 , 9 and 10.\r\n\r\nThere are many other ways like Comments, Dumps, Pin sites, Forums, etc etc but i wont talk about them. Here at makemoneyadultcontent my goal is for you to get thousands of visitors and make money of them. If you love the other content of the website and trust my advice then focus on these first. If you still do not find success then feel free to contact me on Facebook or twitter.\r\nMake Money from Adult traffic - Monetize adult website\r\nThe ultimate goal for any adult site is to\u00a0Make Money Adult traffic or to Monetize adult website.

Generally dating offers are promoted the most in adult affiliate marketing\r\n\r\nPaid reviews or sponsored post. This opportunity of making money will only come when you have a sufficient traffic on your website. All the major companies and product based websites are looking for targeted traffic that converts. Reviews are a great part of marketing, so you can expect emails from these companies who might be looking for paid reviews or sponsored post.

You can even promote an affiliate link and make money off it\r\n\r\n \tAdult Email Traffic\r\n\r\nOne of the best and highly converting traffic source. The problem is to first obtain these email ids. In this world of internet, everyone is doing everything in their power to obtain these email-ids of the visitors, so people are now-a-days skeptical in sharing their email-ids. So you must offer something lucrative (lead magnet) for them to opt-in in your email list.

This website homepage has a list of websites\u00a0in various sections. Few of the sections are listed in the bullet points above. Theporndude gets almost a million hits everyday.

If you have just started your website then forget about they including your website. You need to have alexa ranking of at lest below 250000 in order to be even looked by any of these websites.\r\n\r\nTIP: Install Mailtrack add-on for your browser. This way whenever you will send any email, you will get to know if your email was opened or not and also at what time it was opened by the recipient. Just make an account at mailtrack for gmail, login with your gmail account and grant the permission. Using the service is free of cost.

Be friendly and you can easily get few links to your website. Feel free to make changes in the email script and let me know if your script is getting much better response rate.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nTrick: Drive enormous free traffic from adult tube websites\r\nThe trick comes after you have uploaded the video. The target being getting featured on the home page or rank higher for certain keywords. Yes you read that right, it will be like video optimization for adult tubes.\r\n\r\nSo how does this method work. ?\r\n\r\nPopular adult tube websites get tons of traffic, and we will be targeting to get a small pie of that free adult traffic. I will be using popular adult tube website \u201cXvideos\u201d as an example. Every uploaded video has a \u201cthumbs up\u201d and \u201cthumbs down\u201d option just like youtube has \u201clike and dislike\u201d.\r\n\r\nLoad \u201cFiddler\u201d or any other HTTP Analyzer (For ex: LiveHTTPHeaders for Firefox) and then press the thumbs of button for one of your video.\r\n\r\nYou will be given a new link which looks something like this:\r\n\r\nXvideos.com\/videovote\/11148569\/YES\/1100011001101100110010100100111061115\/?_=1434857696874\r\n\r\nNow as we are embedding the videos that we upload on our website. We embed the videos by copying the iframe embed code. Which looks like\r\n\r\n&lt;iframe src=\"http:\/\/flashservice.xvideos.com\/embedframe\/12142271\" frameborder=0 width=510 height=400 scrolling=no&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;\r\n\r\nNow after you have embedded your video, just below that embed code copy the same embed code with some changes. Here are the list of changes\r\n\r\n \tReplace \u201c:\/\/flashservice.xvideos.com\/embedframe\/12142271\u201d with the link you obtained above\r\n \tChange the value of height and width to zero \u201cwidth=0 height=0\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter your video starts getting some views on your website, every visitor that watches the video on your website, will automatically make a \u201cthumbs up\u201d. This will help in boosting the rating of the video on Xvideos and helping it rank higher.\r\n\r\nApart from xvideos, this method works on many other websites as well. This method can help you Drive enormous free traffic from adult tube websites\r\nAdult Traffic Infographic\r\n\r\n\r\nAdult Traffic Infographic is an overview of how you can drive enormous targeted traffic to your adult website.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf i missed some point or you were not able to understand something, please share your query in the comments section below.

This website is a way to pass my knowledge and leanings to all the people who wants to earn some passive income. I have a network or almost 20 adult websites which make more than $10,000 per month. This includes adult websites, webcam models, clipstore models, porn production etc etc. If you have a willingness to earn some extra cash then do take each article seriously and get up off your lazy ass and start taking some action. Check out my journey into adult tube and how you can also make $3500 per month here: http://makemoneyadultcontent.com/my-journey-to-3500-per-month-from-adult-tube-websites/</div><div class="clear"></div></div></div></div><div id="footer-second" class="footer-widgets-box"><div id="widget_sp_image-38" class="footer-widget widget_sp_image"><div class="footer-widget-top"><h4></h4></div><div class="footer-widget-container"><a href="../hostgator-review-best-web-hosting-adult-porn-websites/index.html" target="_blank" class="widget_sp_image-image-link" title="Adult web hosting image"><img width="300" height="300" alt="Adult web hosting image" class="attachment-full aligncenter" style="max-width: 100%;" src="../wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Adult-web-hosting-image.jpg"/></a></div></div></div></div><div class="clear"></div> </footer><div class="clear"></div><div class="footer-bottom"><div class="container"><div class="alignright"> MakeMoneyAdultContent</div><div class="social-icons"> <a class="ttip-none" title="Google+" href="https://plus.google.com/104122591300920316731/about" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-google-plus"></i></a><a class="ttip-none" title="Facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/makemoneyadultcontent/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-facebook"></i></a><a class="ttip-none" title="Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/makemoneyadult" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a><a class="ttip-none" title="Youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxHkthrmiQZV8C-ybg9knnQ" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-youtube"></i></a></div><div class="alignleft"> © Copyright 2017, All Rights Reserved</div><div class="clear"></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="topcontrol" class="fa fa-angle-up" title="Scroll To Top"></div><div id="fb-root"></div><div id="tve_notification_box"></div><div id="reading-position-indicator"></div><script type='text/javascript'>var wpcf7={"apiSettings":{"root":"http:\/\/www.makemoneyadultcontent.com\/wp-json\/","namespace":"contact-form-7\/v1"},"recaptcha":{"messages":{"empty":"Please verify that you are not a robot."}},"cached":"1"};</script> <script type='text/javascript'>var tie={"mobile_menu_active":"true","mobile_menu_top":"","lightbox_all":"true","lightbox_gallery":"true","woocommerce_lightbox":"yes","lightbox_skin":"dark","lightbox_thumb":"vertical","lightbox_arrows":"","sticky_sidebar":"1","is_singular":"1","SmothScroll":"true","reading_indicator":"true","lang_no_results":"No Results","lang_results_found":"Results Found"};</script> <script type='text/javascript'>var tve_dash_front={"ajaxurl":"http:\/\/www.makemoneyadultcontent.com\/wp-admin\/admin-ajax.php","is_crawler":""};</script> <script type='text/javascript'>var embedVars={"disqusConfig":{"platform":"wordpress@4.8","language":""},"disqusIdentifier":"281 http:\/\/makemoneyadultcontent.com\/?p=281","disqusShortname":"makemoneyadultcontent","disqusTitle":"How to get Free Unlimited direct adult traffic for adult tube website","disqusUrl":"http:\/\/www.makemoneyadultcontent.com\/how-to-get-free-unlimited-direct-traffic-for-adult-tube-website\/","options":{"manualSync":false},"postId":"281"};</script> <script type='text/javascript' src='../wp-content/cache/busting/1/wp-content-plugins-disqus-comment-system-media-js-disqus.js'></script> <script type='text/javascript'>var countVars={"disqusShortname":"makemoneyadultcontent"};</script> <script type='text/javascript' src='../wp-content/cache/busting/1/wp-content-plugins-disqus-comment-system-media-js-count.js'></script> <script src="../wp-content/cache/min/1/af14526a2720d8448ad16c689235e807.js" data-minify="1"></script><script src="../wp-content/cache/min/1/a6392da21f23cde725be0a71001f7810.js" data-minify="1"></script></body>
