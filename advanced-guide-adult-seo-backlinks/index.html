The best part about building adult backlinks and driving traffic is that the competition is comparatively much lower and hence ranking websites is easier. Before moving forward with teaching you how to do adult SEO of your website, you need to first understand how SEO works, and hence I will first be explaining the basic cores and fundamentals of SEO to you</p><h2><strong>Why would I want my website ranked higher in search results?</strong></h2><p>The higher the ranking, the more number of visitors your website will get. According to data, 50-60% people click on the first result of a search query, 20-25%o on the second search result and only 8-12% on third search results. So you can imagine if your website is on second page of Google, thenÂ probably no one will be coming to your website for the target search query.</p><p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3086" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=" data-lazy-src="http://makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-08-07_12-20-58.png" alt="The Advanced Guide to Adult SEO and Backlinks" width="790" height="413" data-lazy-srcset="http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-08-07_12-20-58.png 790w, http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-08-07_12-20-58-300x157.png 300w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 790px) 100vw, 790px"/><noscript><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3086" src="http://makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-08-07_12-20-58.png" alt="The Advanced Guide to Adult SEO and Backlinks" width="790" height="413" srcset="http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-08-07_12-20-58.png 790w, http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-08-07_12-20-58-300x157.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 790px) 100vw, 790px"/></noscript></p><h2><strong>Why should i care about organic traffic from Google?</strong></h2><p>The answer is simple, its free and targeted. Let me explain each point in detail:</p><ol><li>Free traffic: Since you are not paying to drive traffic to your website, people are finding your website on the platform of Google and coming to your website. You don&#8217;t have to spend any money to drive those visitors to your website</li><li>Targeted traffic: This is very important. If your website is about selling guitars, but the people coming to your website are interested in buying a mobile phone, then no one will stay on your website for long. When people are coming to your website from Google, they are searching for something that your website has to offer and hence when they land on your website they are more likely to purchase what you have to offer. Google only ranks those website to a particular search query that has content related to that search term</li></ol><p>Whenever someone has a website, the most important metric is the traffic your website gets. The more the traffic, the more money you will make, whatever be the niche you are in. If you are not utilizing the power of Google then most probably you are missing out on a big opportunity</p><h2><strong>Who are you to explain about Adult search engine optimization, are you an expert or Guru?</strong></h2><p>Let me clear everything first, I am no guru or an SEO expert. But I have been building websites for almost 7 years now (5 years in the adult industry) and the majority of my traffic comes from Google for almost 20+ websites I have (making me more than $10,000/month). I love to learn and hence have learned from the experts in the SEO industry, I have purchased many expensive SEO courses to learn as well. Also, all the techniques I will be mentioning later are being performed on my websites as well, hence I can guarantee they work</p><p>Here is a snapshot of one of my website, as you can see approximately 70% of my traffic comes from Google, all this happened just because I followed these SEO techniques</p><p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3087" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=" data-lazy-src="http://makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-08-07_12-34-57.png" alt="The Advanced Guide to Adult SEO and Backlinks" width="582" height="342" data-lazy-srcset="http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-08-07_12-34-57.png 582w, http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-08-07_12-34-57-300x176.png 300w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 582px) 100vw, 582px"/><noscript><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3087" src="http://makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-08-07_12-34-57.png" alt="The Advanced Guide to Adult SEO and Backlinks" width="582" height="342" srcset="http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-08-07_12-34-57.png 582w, http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-08-07_12-34-57-300x176.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 582px) 100vw, 582px"/></noscript></p><h3 id="item-two"><strong>Ok I am convinced now, start teaching me SEO</strong></h3><p>Great lets start with your adult SEO training and how you can also drive enormous adult traffic for your adult website. Here are the Goals of SEO:</p><p>And how do we do this: Google looks at what is on the website, Google then looks at the links that are coming into the site, Google then gives certain links more power than others. In a nutshell, the most relevant site with the most powerful adult backlinks coming in wins the race and is awarded the highest search engine rankings</p><p>The most important Four points in your Adult SEO campaign will be:</p><ul><li>Relevance of the page</li><li>Authority of the Domain</li><li>Authority of Inbound links</li><li>Relevance of inbound links</li></ul><p>Lets Go through each point one by one</p><h3><strong>Relevance of the page</strong></h3><p>This comes under on-page Adult SEO. This basically is how relevant the page you are trying to rank is with the search query. The points that matter are:</p><ol><li><strong>Title of the page:</strong> Make sure your target keyword is in the title of the page</li><li><strong>Description of the page:</strong> Keywords that you are targeting must be in the description of the page</li><li><strong>The content of the page:</strong> The content must be at least 500 words and properly optimised for the keyword that you are targeting.</li><li><strong>Titles of the image:</strong> Images should have &#8220;ALT TEXT&#8221; which includes the keywords that you are targeting</li><li><strong>Videos of the page</strong>: Having a relevant video increases authority of the post</li><li>Other On-page factors</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Authority of the Domain</h3><p>This factor is harder to emulate as this cannot be done overnight. It takes the time to build domain authority (DA). A number of factors affect domain authority such as:</p><ol><li>The links pointing to the domain name</li><li>The number of unique high-quality SEO optimised pages/posts on your website</li><li>Social factors (social traffic, CTR (click-through rates) and other social signals)</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Authority of Inbound links</h3><p>This is one of the most important factors and we will be covering this in detail throughout the post. Adult backlinks are the key factors that will help your website rank higher and push your website in front of thousands of people. There are many blackhat ways to build thousands of adult backlinks within one day, but all that will do to your website is get penalized. The most important thing is to make high-quality adult backlinks. Focus on Quality vs Quantity. When it comes to the authority of links, following points should be kept in mind:</p><ol><li>Inbound links or the backlink to your website</li><li>Power of the pages where are inbound link is present</li><li>Power of the domain where the inbound adult backlink is present</li></ol><h3>Relevance of inbound links</h3><p>This factor has always be ignored by most of the webmasters that are struggling with getting their websites ranked higher in Google. If your website is about selling Guitars, but majority of your adult backlinks are coming from websites that are totally unrelated to guitars like Dog food, computer peripheral etc, then the power of that backlinkÂ is significantly reduced. You would want the adult backlinks to come from related domain niche, such as guitar training, guitar schools etc. Relevancy is the key to high quality adult backlinks</p><p>These were the top four factors that you need to consider before going forward with your adult seo training and building high quality adult backlinks. I have Â list of four amazing SEO tools, that will help you improve SEO of your website, they are trusted by millions of people, and are considered to be the best tools by SEO experts:</p><ol><li>Majestic SEO (Accurate and Simple):</li><li>MOZ (Best representation of Authority)</li><li>Ahrefs (most links counted, but sadly a paid tool)</li><li>SEMrush (similar tool with great power) (<a href="../semrush-coupon-free-trail-account-code/index.html">SEMRUSH Coupon Free Pro Account for 14 days Worth $150</a>)</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The two key tools we will be using are:</p><h2><strong>Majestic SEO</strong></h2><p>Trust Flow and Citation Flow are calculated. Trust flow is the best representation of authority of theÂ website. You must be targeting websites that have a Trust Flow and Citation flow with a ration of 1:1, this indicates that the website is high quality. You would also want the trust flow to be at least <strong>10.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Moz Ratings</h2><p>First, i will recommend you to install the Moz bar.Â Â Domain authority and page authority are good measures when coupled with TrustÂ flow to get the profile and authority of any website</p><p>Note: Moz misses a lot of adult backlinks and hence the number of adult backlinks and the sources of these adult backlinks will not be the complete profile, fo that i will recommend using Majestic and Ahrefs</p><p>Before continuing further, let me tell about one few more important tips and tricks that you can use to optimize your post and website</p><h2 id="item-three"><strong>Basic SEO adult website set up</strong></h2><p>You must install &#8220;Yoast SEO&#8221; plugin for your website and it will automatically tell you how to optimise your page is. Let me first also cover other important on-page adult SEO factors that you need to focus on. I have written guides on many of them and I highly recommend to go check them out:</p><ol><li><a href="../buying-seo-friendly-adult-domain-name/index.html">Buying SEO friendly adult domain name</a>,Â <a href="../how-to-choose-a-domain-name-for-your-website/index.html">How to choose a domain name for your website</a></li><li><a href="http://makemoneyadultcontent.com/the-ultimate-guide-reduce-bounce-rate/">The Ultimate Guide Reduce bounce rate</a></li><li><a href="http://makemoneyadultcontent.com/wordpress-plugins-that-maximize-earnings-and-seo/">WordPress plugins that maximize earnings and SEO</a></li></ol><p>Let me explainÂ to you how you can use internal linking to rank pages of your website and how internal linking can easily optimize your website. If you look at the above stated bullet points then those are internal links of other posts on this website. Internal linking is a great way of passing link juice between pages.Here is an image to explain this better:</p><p>By creating relevant pages or supporting pages and then pointing to the main page you are trying to rank is a great way of adult seo. In this image, the arrows are a representation of from where the link juice is getting transferred to the target pages. If all the pages are pointing to a single page, then it indicates to Google, that this page has something important to offer, also the link juice is getting passed and hence that target page starts to rank higher on search results.</p><p><strong>Adult friendly domain name</strong></p><p>It is highly recommended to have your focus keyword in your domain name. Google gives special ranking benefits to such websites. Although this feature has been continuously abused by people, but I have been doing the same for my new websites and its still working. Try not to make the domain name exact as the focus keyword, rather add a helping word to avoid getting blacklisted</p><p><strong>High Quality content</strong></p><p>I have stressed on this point multiple times, because this is one of the most important area of your website. In this highly competitive worked of online websites, t be able to stand out of the crowd you need to offer enormous value to the reader from your website. A website visitor has many options when he is looking for some information, for him/her to become a fan of your website you need to give him exactly what he wants and even more.</p><p>Here are some pointers to keep in mind</p><ol><li>The content must be unique</li><li>Dated articles must be updated. Things change everyday, so a 1-year-old article might not be useful today, so update it with relevant information.</li><li>Make it an easy read. Use friendly and engaging language. Add media (pictures, videos, gifs etc.) to elaborate and explain in a much better way</li><li>Add articles on a regular basis. A regularly updated website is crawled multiple times by Google and given preference in search engine rankings</li><li>Interlinking relevant articles. Give them a reason to stay long. Interlink articles on your website so that the visitor stays for a much longer time.</li><li>Donât write small 200-300 words articles. Try to write at least 600 words in each article. (Note: Do not add irrelevant information if your article is of lesser words, always remember add as much value as possible.</li></ol><p><strong>Adult Seo optimizing your article or post</strong></p><p>After writing your high quality article/post, you need to optimize it for search engines. I hope you are using WordPress CMS for your website. InstallÂ <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/">Yeast SEO</a>Â and try to get green light. Follow all the recommendations it says and fulfill them all. This plugin alone will help you a lot in you on-site adult seo optimization</p><p><strong>Leverage the visitor for Seo and more traffic</strong></p><p>A high quality article which can have a positive affect on the visitor if more likely to be shared by him/her. So make a call-to-action in order to make him share the article on social media platforms. Commenting on the articles can also help a lot</p><p><strong>Submitting the Sitemap to Google</strong></p><p>Using Google Webmaster to submit the sitemap. Google webmaster will be your got place for chaching your website ranking on Google- the leading search engine.</p><p>Generate the sitemap of your WordPress website using this plugin :Â <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/bwp-google-xml-sitemaps/">BWP sitemap</a></p><p><strong>Adding keyword rich site title and tagline</strong></p><p>Adding the focus keyword of your niche or website in site title also helps in seo benefits and is a good seo strategy. Add relevant additional important keywords in site tagline</p><p><strong>Adding Alt tags to images</strong></p><p>Any image you upload to your website can be adult seo optimized by adding the focus keyword of that article/post as alt tag of the image. This will help drive additional traffic from image search engines. Also this will improve overall seo score of the article/post</p><p><strong>Keyword friendly Article/post Permalink</strong></p><p>Having the focus keyword in the urn of your articles is also very important. So make sure that the keyword you are targeting is shown in the url structure of your articles</p><p><strong>Highlighting or making the keywords bold</strong></p><p>Make sure to highlight, italic or bold the keywords in your articles to get that extra seo benefit</p><p><strong>Website speed is a very important parameter</strong></p><p>I have already written articles on this topic check them out here:Â <a href="http://makemoneyadultcontent.com/speed-up-website-decrease-wordpress-page-load-time/">Speed up adult Website</a></p><p>Do not miss this step. This is highly critical; a fast loading website is given special preference over a slow website. Also I saw a jump in multiple website rankings when I improved the speed of my website</p><p>Tip: Try to get the Data Center, or your server close to the country where majority of your traffic is coming from. For example, if 80% of your traffic is coming from United States, then getting a US server will be extremely beneficial.</p><h2 id="item-four"><strong>Rookie mistakes, beginner seo mistakes, newbie seo mistakes, and SEO traps to stay away from</strong></h2><p>Let me cover the mistakes that you can make while doing search engine optimisation of your website. learning from other people&#8217;s mistakes is the best form of learning and today i will cover exactly what you should not do for your adult website linkbuilding</p><ol><li>Thinking this SEO stuff is so complex and giving up &#8211; Dont do that, path to success is not easy my friend</li><li>Buying links, using black hat methods of linkbuilding, indulging in link farms, link pyramids, etc &#8211; Dont even think about these stuff</li><li>Building too many backlinks too quickly &#8211; this will alert google about something fishy and you might get a penalty, and trust me recovering from a Google penalty is very tough</li><li>Focusing on quantity vs quality, One high quality backlink is much more powerful than 100 crappy adult backlinks my friend</li></ol><p>Here is an article i wrote that might be helpful:Â <a href="http://makemoneyadultcontent.com/learn-from-my-adult-tube-website-mistakes/">Learn from my adult tube website mistakes</a></p><p>Another beginner mistake is to not consider the &#8220;Nofollow&#8221; links. Nofollow adult backlinks are those that do point to your website or page, but do not pass the link juice and hence are not considered by Google. Newbies think since they are not helpful to rankings they don&#8217;t build them, but trust me they are important as well. The trustÂ flow metric also considers &#8220;Nofollow&#8221; links to build the authority of the website. Also Google might be alert if the website only has &#8220;doFollow&#8221; links as that might not look natural. Even social signals are all &#8220;nofollow&#8221; links but Google gives weightage for social signals for rankings</p><p><strong>Let me also cover Mobile Responsiveness:</strong> Since you all know that the world is shifting to mobile. More and more websites are witnessing an ever increasing mobile users. Facebook themselves have accepted that their mobile users are so many times higher then desktop users. Google has been giving ranking benefits to mobile-friendly websites, by this they mean:</p><ol><li>Fast loading website on mobile</li><li>Responsive design, easily adaptable to any mobile screen and hence increased user experience</li></ol><p>You must have also seen on Google search results that the websites that are optimised for mobile (mobile friendly website theme) has a small &#8220;mobile-friendly&#8221; written along the search result. So make sure the theme of your website is responsive and easily adaptable with every screen size, if you are purchasing a theme from platforms such as Themeforest, then you don&#8217;t need to worry about it as the developers are making mobile friendly themes now. I witnessed a sudden increase in my traffic on one of my website when i switched to a mobile-friendly them.</p><p><strong>Staying Away from PBN&#8217;s: </strong>PBN (Private blog network) was earlier used by many people to rank their website on Google, it is just like a link farm and total black hat way of gaining SEO rankings. Is is highly unsafe to buy links from PBN&#8217;s and Link farms. Although many experinced SEO experts know how to use them the right way, but as an amateur SEO person you should stay away from them.</p><h2 id="item-five"><strong>Adult SEO Keywords &#8211; Queries, longtail &#8211; Get More Organic Traffic</strong></h2><p>Lets discuss overÂ Adult SEO Keywords &#8211; Queries, longtail &#8211; Get More Organic Traffic. Keywords are the most important criteria you choose to optimize the posts that you add to your website. Google checks your website for specific keywords to give a ranking to your website on its search results. Finding, targeting and then optimizing your adult website for the right keyword Â is extremely important</p><h2>Pornhub Keyword tool &#8211; Best keyword tool pornhub</h2><p>if you are searching for pornhub keyword tools then trust me you wont find a genuine product, because there is no such thing as pornhub keyword tool.</p><p>The best ways to find adult keywords or pornhub keywords is to use tools like Semrush and Ahrefs and then either use their own keyword tools for finding search volume of popular keywords like &#8220;porn&#8221; etc. You can also put the ranking URL (no#1 position) into Ahrefs and then find out about how much organic traffic is driven to this link and which keywords are driving thet traffic.</p><p>Porn seo is not that dificult if you know your tools right and also if you follow this guide diligently.</p><h3><strong>What are Adult SEO keywords?</strong></h3><p>One thing you have to understand is that the primary goal of Google is to offer the best and the most relevant article on the first result for any search query. I the end the primary purpose of Google is to provide the information that the person is looking for. If that person is able to find that information in the first link itself, then the purpose of Google is served.</p><p>Keywords are a way google get to know a little about the content of your article. Apart from other adult seo factors, Keywords is like a reflection of your website in the eyes of google.</p><p><a href="https://makemoneyadultcontent.leadpages.co/leadbox/14232c4f3f72a2%3A14747c717f46dc/5733636452122624/"><br/> </a>If you website is about <em>Blowjob,Â </em>then queries and keyword such as &#8220;<em>Blowjob videos</em>&#8221;Â is a keyword. You target is to rank on number one spot of search results for this search query.</p><p>Finding the right keywords in not enough, you then need to optimize your website and article according to the keywords you are targeting.</p><h3><strong>What are long tail keywords?</strong></h3><p>because of increased competition on the internet, and thousands of websites being opened in almost every niche, it has become extremely difficult to outrank already established websites for certain keywords. For example, you will find Wikipedia articles on majority of general topics as first search result, and it is extremely difficult to out rank those article, so you have to target the long tail keywords.</p><p>Lets say someone is searching for &#8220;blowjob video girl sucking big cock abc studio&#8221;, this is an example of long tail keyword. Since with just &#8220;<em>blowjob videos&#8221; ,Â </em>already thousands of website is targeting that keyword because of its high search volume, you can target longtail keywords to get that additional traffic with less competition. The only drawback is that very few people are searching for those queries.But if you have a website where you are selling affiliate products, even few extra sales can make all the difference.Â Also ranking higher for long tail search keywords is comparatively much easier.</p><h3><strong>Optimizing your website for keywords and internal linking ?</strong></h3><p>You will have to think like the person searching the query. What is going on in their mind when they are making a query on Google.</p><p>People generally search for pornstar names, or the studio names that are producing these porn videos.

I will be covering a lot of ways and methods on how you can start linkbuilding for your adult website. Let me first give you the pros and cons of adult backlink building:</p><p>Here are the advantages you already have:</p><ol><li><strong>Low competition:Â </strong>Compared to other normal websites, adult websites are comparatively easier to rank because competition is way less.</li></ol><p>Here is the disadvantage you have:</p><ol><li><strong>Lack of link opportunities:</strong> Finding backlink opportunities (especially high quality ones) is extremely difficult. As normal websites do not want to link themselves with adult websites and hence you have limited resources to build adult backlinks</li></ol><p>Let me list down the ways of building a link profile for your website one by one.</p><h3>Method 1: Being a link detective</h3><p>Although there are great many ways of link building for normal non-adult websites, but when it comes yo adult the opportunities are very less. One of the best ways to make backlinks is to fist find opportunities by checking the link profiles of your competition.</p><p>Step-1: Make an excel sheet (here you will copy all the links of the places you will be making backlink on later)</p><p>Step-2: Use tools like majestic,Â https://www.ranksignals.com (free tool) for looking at backlink profile of your competition. For every link check the Trust flow, and Domain authority if you find a good backlink opportunity then copy the link in your excel sheet. You should check the link profile of atleast 8-10 of your competition</p><p>Using this method alone you will find hundreds of places from where you can build adult backlinks</p><h3>Method 2: Using comments and Forums</h3><p>although this method has been heavily used for ages now and hence Google has stopped giving it much relevance. You must not spend much of your time on building comments adult backlinks at least.</p><p>TIP: One very important tip Â i can give you is to not use &#8220;Anchor text&#8217; for your adult backlinks when using comments and Forums. Since these links has gotten a negative connotation when it comes to link building, always paste the direct link for the page that you are targeting. Using anchor text will highly increase the chances of Google penalty</p><p>Here is a list of search commands you can use to find relevant comment opportunities:</p><ol><li>keyword &#8220;1 comment&#8221;</li><li>keyword &#8220;2 comments&#8221;</li><li>keyword &#8220;3 comments&#8221;</li><li>keyword &#8220;4 comments&#8221;</li><li>keyword disqus</li><li>keyword &#8220;leave a comment&#8221;</li></ol><p>For forums you can use:</p><ol><li>keyword&#8221;forum&#8221;</li><li>keyword&#8221;powered by Fireboard&#8221;</li><li>keyword&#8221;powered by ip.board&#8221;</li><li>keyword&#8221;powered by phpbb&#8221;</li><li>keyword&#8221;powered by phpbb3&#8243;</li><li>keyword&#8221;powered by SMF&#8221;</li><li>keyword&#8221;powered by vbulletin&#8221;</li><li>keywordforum</li><li>keywordintitle:forum</li><li>keywordinurl:forum</li></ol><h3><strong>Method 3: Using link exchanges from relevant websites</strong></h3><p>You might have seen this on many adult websites where they list a number of websites in a widget with title &#8220;Our Friends&#8221; . This helps them getting adult backllinks from relevant websites in their niche. You can easily make a list of websites in your domain and contact them though email for link exchange. Make sure no one will link to you if your website traffic is not comparable to the one you are trying to get a link back from.</p><p>TIP: Make sure you check the trust flow and Domain authority of the website you are trying to get a link from. You would not want to link to a website which is spammy or low quality</p><p>I have written an article on this:Â <a href="http://makemoneyadultcontent.com/link-exchange-website-adult-seo/">Make Adult backlinks using Link exchange website</a></p><h3><strong>Method 4: Using other not so great methods of link building</strong></h3><p>These methods were working great earlier or few years back, but now they don&#8217;t work that much. But building links through theseÂ techniques will help you diversify your link profiles and help your link building look more natural. I have written several articles on this:</p><p>There are many places to build backlinks. First let me give to a checklist of what you must do and must keep in mind</p><ol><li>Vary your anchor text</li><li>Build adult backlinks of all quality (33% low quality, 33% moderate quality, 33% high quality)</li><li>Only make maximum of 3-5 adult backlinks in a day</li></ol><ul><li><a href="http://makemoneyadultcontent.com/list-best-picture-dump-sites/">Best picture dump sites</a></li><li><a href="http://makemoneyadultcontent.com/list-best-picture-dump-sites/">List of Pin porn websites for adult Backlink and Seo</a></li><li><a href="http://makemoneyadultcontent.com/list-best-porn-tgp-sites/">Best Porn TGP sites</a></li><li><a href="http://makemoneyadultcontent.com/list-best-free-adult-image-hosting-sites/">List of Best Free Adult image hosting sites</a></li><li><a href="http://makemoneyadultcontent.com/build-adult-backlinks-using-whos-pornstar-sites/">Build adult backlinks using Whoâs That Pornstar sites</a></li></ul><p>Remember one very important thing. Google has changed its algorithm and now they want the backlink to come from a website that is in the same niche or related niche of your website. So make 50% of your backlinks from the websites that are in your niche.</p><p>Also check out these articles:</p><ul><li><a href="http://makemoneyadultcontent.com/trick-use-high-quality-adult-backlinks/">The trick i use for high quality adult backlinks</a></li><li><a href="http://makemoneyadultcontent.com/avoid-overoptimization-seo-and-backlink-building/"><span class="item-title">Avoid Overoptimization âBacklink Building</span></a></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Method 5: Adding value and getting a link back</strong></h3><p>This is more like a smart strategy, also this might not work will all types of adult websites. But this method requires some work from your end hence you will have to do some hardwork but the links you will get are amazing. Let me give you an example, don&#8217;t you like it when someone helps you without any ill motive or expecting something in return, this is what we will be exploiting in this method. In this method you will be going through the websites in your niche, help the owner of the website in one way or another, and then ask them for a link to your website.</p><p><strong>Remember:</strong> If you get a &#8220;Anchor Text&#8221; link well and good, but even if you were able to get a direct url link even that has some power to boost your rankings.</p><p>Here are the steps that you need to follow:</p><ol><li>Make a list of all the websites that are in your niche</li><li>Sort the websites in terms of the quality of website and the power of backlink you will get. (use tools such as MOZ and Majestic for ranking the website, you can use the metric of Trust flow to rank the websites)</li><li>Start going through each website and look for any one of the following<ul><li>Broken links on the website (giving 404 response) (use browser plugins for this)</li><li>Deleted videos if it is a tube website (make a list of at least 50 of the deleted videos on that website)</li><li>If the content is outdated, and you have the knowledge of updated content</li><li>If the website is extremely slow or the user experience is pathetic</li><li>Any other type of value that you can add to the website owner</li></ul></li><li>Do the above steps for as many websites as you can , also make sure you keep a column for contact information (either contact form url or if direct email is available)</li><li>Draft an email and add the value in your email and send it to each website.</li><li>Once the website owner sees the email and thanks you for helping him, you can then tell them about your website and how it is related to the same niche as their website. 9 times out of 10, they will be happy to link back to your website.</li></ol><p>The motive here is to help other person first and then ask for something in return. By adding value first you were able to win his trust and then he/she will be highly likely to link back to you. Just make sure the link is &#8220;dofollow&#8221;.</p><h3><strong>Method 6: Sponsored Posts or Paying money for links</strong></h3><p>Sponsored posts should be your last tactic of link building. Let me also tell you that they come under BlackHatways of adult backlilnks building since we are paying to get our links on other peoples website. If you read earlier in this article i asked you to stay away from buying links (i was talking about PBN&#8217;s and link farms) , Â but sponsored posts are still a safer and more effective method that buying links because they are real, active , clean sites that just happen to make money from advertisers (Just like Inc, Forbes etc)</p><p><em><strong>Note 1</strong>:</em> This method can get expensive, generally depending on the quality of the website, you might have to pay in between ($30-$300) per post, but mostly in ~$100 range. Worry not i will tell you about negotiation techniques</p><p><em><strong>Note 2:</strong></em> Make sure you do extensive research on the quality of the link &#8211; make sure that it is not a link farm.</p><p>Our goal will be to look for websites that are looking for a monetization method, and hence by offering them some money in exchange of a Link is mutual benefit. So make an excel sheet and fill it with websites that are related in your niche &#8211; blogs, tubes, etc. Also make sure you make a column for contacting them either through contact form, but email is preferred</p><p>Before contacting them do the following checks:</p><ol><li>Domain authority and Trust flow</li><li>Content quality(are they indulging in spamming)</li><li>Do they Â &#8220;nofollow&#8221; the sponsored post or not</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Negotiating the price: Keep one thing in mind, that the person you are contacting need the money more than you think. So tell them honestly that the prices they are asking is out of your budget and then give them a reason why they should lower the price. 9 times out of 10 they will come up with a lower price.</p><p>I understand that the number of websites wont be large as the niche is adult in nature, but you also have to understand that since the competition is not that high, even few links will be really helpful in driving the rankings of your website high up in the search engines</p><p>Other tips:</p><p><strong>Getting adult backlinks from Websites and BlogsÂ </strong></p><p>One most important thing to keep in mind is, get links from website which are in your niche. Relevant websites are the only ones that you must be targeting for your backlinks.</p><p>Here are the steps:</p><ol><li>Make a list of websites in your niche. (These are your competitors)</li><li>Email them through their contact form about your website and how both can benefit from link trade</li><li>Since the websites are on same niche and targeting the same keywords, the strength of the backlink will be huge</li><li>Usually a link is placed in the right widget or footer as &#8220;friends of xyz.com&#8221;</li></ol><p>Remember if you are just starting out then donât expect the big players in your niche to link to you. The best way is to target the website who are almost equivalent to your level of traffic</p><p><strong>Getting social media links</strong></p><p>Google has mentioned that they give some weightage to social signals. So if your articles or posts are getting shared on the social media platforms a lot, then this will directly help you in seo rankings in search engine results.</p><p>You can automate this process by using a website like Hootsuite.com. Also there are plugins which automatically post your recently published article automatically to your social media accounts.</p><p>Also make sure to add Call-to-action, asking your website readers to share your content on social media platforms. Remember people will only share content they loved. This will only happen when you write high quality content in your website</p><p>One problem you might face is that not all social media platforms allow adult contend. The ones that do is</p><ol><li>Tumblr</li><li>Reddit</li><li>Twitter</li></ol><p>For other platforms like Facebook, be wary of the guidelines and post only stuff that will not get you banned.</p><p><strong>Adult Directories and link pyramids</strong></p><p>If you have followed my other adult seo guides for porn sites, then you know how much I hate these spammy link building techniques. Google will instantly blacklist your website when they find your website indulging in this shady blackhat ways of backlinks building. Instead of helping you in SEO they will negatively affect your website rankings</p><p>Even if you spot an adult directory in your niche, prefer quality over quality. Stay away from spammy adult directories.</p><p><strong>Using email list for adult backlinks building and adult seo</strong></p><p>Email list is a critical tool if you are an adult performer (clip store studio owner or camming model). If you own an adult tube website, then creating a mailing list wont really help you a lot.</p><p>Email list can be utilized in several ways</p><ol><li>Building stronger relationships with your followers</li><li>Adding more value to your subscribers</li><li>Creating a community, which is an essential part of a website</li><li>An available audience to promote anything<ol><li>Donât misuse this feature. First add a lot of value in their life, and only then you can request them or drive them to something that you want for yourself</li></ol></li></ol><p>So how can you do adult seo using email list?</p><p>You can give a freebie (like and eBook or any other thing) in exchange of asking them to share your content on their social networks. You can even create a content locker, where the content will only be available when someone follows certain stenos like</p><ol><li>Liking on Facebook Page</li><li>Following on twitter</li><li>Sharing the article on their twitter timeline</li></ol><p><strong>Most important TIP:</strong> It is very important that you spend quite some time on Adult SEO and link building.

Also, since majority of people are generally searching for a video or a pornstar using queries such as &#8220;<em>abc videos</em>&#8221; etc hence that tag page will then rank higher for such search queries.</p><h2>Adult SEO Infographic</h2><p>Adult SEO Infographic breaks the myths about doing search engine optimisation of your adult website.</p><p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4409" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=" data-lazy-src="http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Adult-SEO-1.png" alt="Adult SEO infographic" width="800" height="2000" data-lazy-srcset="http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Adult-SEO-1.png 800w, http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Adult-SEO-1-120x300.png 120w, http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Adult-SEO-1-410x1024.png 410w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"/><noscript><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4409" src="../wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Adult-SEO-1.png" alt="Adult SEO infographic" width="800" height="2000" srcset="http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Adult-SEO-1.png 800w, http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Adult-SEO-1-120x300.png 120w, http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Adult-SEO-1-410x1024.png 410w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"/></noscript></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To embed this Infographic on your website, use the following code:</p><p><strong>&lt;img class=&#8221;aligncenter size-full wp-image-3033&#8243; src=&#8221;http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Adult-SEO-1.png&#8221; alt=&#8221;Adult SEO Infographic&#8221; width=&#8221;800&#8243; height=&#8221;2000&#8243; /&gt;</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3034" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=" data-lazy-src="http://makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Adult-SEO.png" alt="Adult Backlinks Infographic" width="800" height="2000" data-lazy-srcset="http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Adult-SEO.png 800w, http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Adult-SEO-120x300.png 120w, http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Adult-SEO-410x1024.png 410w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"/><noscript><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3034" src="http://makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Adult-SEO.png" alt="Adult Backlinks Infographic" width="800" height="2000" srcset="http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Adult-SEO.png 800w, http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Adult-SEO-120x300.png 120w, http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Adult-SEO-410x1024.png 410w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"/></noscript></p><p>Adult Backlinks Infographic gives you an overview of what you can expect while building adult backlinks .

Although the methods remain the same, but not all the websites accept adult content thereby creating a problem for adult webmasters.</p><p>If you witness a sudden drop in your website visitors or traffic, then you might have suffered from a Google penalty. It is extremely hard to recover from a penalty, hence i advise you to follow some guidelines to prevent yourself in the first place</p><p>However sometimes, unaware people indulge in <strong>SEO over optimization </strong>and suffer from Google penalties and losing all the visitors and hardwork.This article will cover the best practices to follow so that you are safe and immune from any Google penalties and get quality search engine rankings.</p><p>Adult SEO is a complicated game and one needs to learn by trial and error what works and what doesn&#8217;t. Both on-page and off-page factors are considered by Google&#8217;s spiders when crawling a website.I will be listing down some key points, which i have learned over years of being into adult industry. Follow these SEO practices:</p><p><em><strong>1) Do not use black hat or any other unscrupulous adult link building techniques</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>2) Avoid keyword stuffing, or rather do not overdo it (on post, page and domain)</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>3) Keep the keyword density below 7%</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>4) Stay away from duplicate content, write your own original high quality content</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>5) Do not ever link to spam websites, link farms, or any other shady place of link exchange. Few quality backlinks are worth more than thousands of worthless links</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>6) Avoid grammatical errors, spelling mistakes in your content</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>7) Never try to trick or fool the search engines, sooner or later it will backfire</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>8) Do not try to make thousands of adult backlink on a daily basis, link building should look natural and hence devote one hour everyday and only make quality backlinks. As the website starts getting more traffic then you can increase the number of links you make per day. It is all about looking natural in the eyes of Google</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>9) Do not waste your time building no-dofollow backlinks, as they wont be considered by Google for ranking your website</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>10) Do not buy gigs from Fiverr or Seoclerks, which promise tens of thousands of backlinks in few days. You will lose both the money and your website rankings</strong></em></p><p>When a search engine websites crawls a website, it looks at many different parameters to rank your website in comparison to others in your competition. If you follow quality SEO methods then sooner or later you will start ranking higher for your chosen focus keyword.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Porn SEO trick that worked for me</h2><p>I don&#8217;t know why it works but it has been giving me tremendous results for last three years. I found this trick by chance. This gives my website initial attention that you needs of Google. When you just start your website its very difficult to get noticed. There are already many established websites in your niche and they are the ones that get recommended by google in the search results.</p><p>These beginning days of you website are the most difficult once. You barely get traffic and you do everything to increase it to a acceptable level.</p><p>Once when i was creating a tube website, instead of focusing on building backlinks like i used to do, i just started doing tube uploads with branding to let the people come back to my website. What this did was people started typing the domain name of my website on Google and then traffic started pouring in. The best part about this traffic was that since the traffic is targeted , the bounce rate was only close to 20-25%. That must have given a strong indication to Google that this website has something of great value to offer.</p><p>Once i stopped my tube uploads, i could see that i started ranking for related keywords in my niche without even building any backlinks.</p><p>So, just because people came to my website after searching my domain name on Google and stayed there for a very long time, that helped me in my Adult SEO a lot. I am not sure why this trick works, or the reason i am assuming is right or wrong, i just know it works. Let me show you a screenshot of what i am trying to say:</p><p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1087" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=" data-lazy-src="http://makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2016-04-15_15-00-02.png" alt="An amazing trick that works for me" width="988" height="168" data-lazy-srcset="http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2016-04-15_15-00-02.png 988w, http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2016-04-15_15-00-02-300x51.png 300w, http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2016-04-15_15-00-02-768x131.png 768w, http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2016-04-15_15-00-02-610x104.png 610w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 988px) 100vw, 988px"/><noscript><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1087" src="http://makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2016-04-15_15-00-02.png" alt="An amazing trick that works for me" width="988" height="168" srcset="http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2016-04-15_15-00-02.png 988w, http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2016-04-15_15-00-02-300x51.png 300w, http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2016-04-15_15-00-02-768x131.png 768w, http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2016-04-15_15-00-02-610x104.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 988px) 100vw, 988px"/></noscript></p><p>As you can see, after tube uploads i saw a great influx of traffic and within a week in my Google Webmaster i could see many search queries for which i was ranking at not so bad positions.</p><p><em><b>Legal disclaimer:</b> This article is for information only.

With my 7+ years experince in building adult seo website.\r\n\r\nOrganic traffic is the best way when you are searching for how to promote adult site?. I have done it multiple times on more than 30+ of my adult websites, ranging from webcam models, adult blogs, selling porn clips, escort website, and hundreds of clients websites as well.\r\n\r\nThis article is an\u00a0Advanced Guide to Adult SEO and adult Backlinks. I will try to cover the majority of the things that works and you must also do to supercharge the adult seo of your adult website. I will first explain what SEO (search engine optimization) is and then will tell you how it has changed over the years. I will also cover recent trends, working techniques, methods, tips, tricks to drive enormous organic traffic to your adult website.\r\n\r\nSearch engine optimization is the best form of adult website marketing in my opinion. Adult marketing when we talk about Seo porn websites is done through getting your websites in high search results page.\r\n\r\nThis article will be beneficial to you if you are anyone from the list:\r\n\r\n \tCurious to learn about SEO\r\n \tOwner of any kind of adult website\r\n \tAdult seo company and companies providing adult seo services\r\n \tWebcam model\/camgirl\/adult performer\/clipstore studio or model\/Escort\/adult escort website\r\n \tAdult webmaster\r\n \tAdult affiliate marketer or into adult affiliate\r\n\r\nBefore moving forward let me first take a query that i get a lot in my email:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince this guide is more than 10,000 word long hence I have created a TOC\u00a0for easy navigation for you all. I have divided this guide in chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdult SEO - The Advanced guide on driving insane organic traffic\r\nWhat is SEO and what do you mean by Adult SEO?\r\nThis is how Wikipedia defines SEO.\u00a0SEO stands for search engine optimisation, and hence the goal of SEO is to optimize your website in such a way that your website is ranked higher in search results of major search engines like Google, Bing etc. (Although we will only focus on Google, as majority of market share is occupied by them)\r\n\r\nAdult SEO is no different from normal SEO, however, the link building process (which I will talk about later) is a little different. The best part about building adult backlinks and driving traffic is that the competition is comparatively much lower and hence ranking websites is easier. Before moving forward with teaching you how to do adult SEO of your website, you need to first understand how SEO works, and hence I will first be explaining the basic cores and fundamentals of SEO to you\r\nWhy would I want my website ranked higher in search results?\r\nThe higher the ranking, the more number of visitors your website will get. According to data, 50-60% people click on the first result of a search query, 20-25%o on the second search result and only 8-12% on third search results. So you can imagine if your website is on second page of Google, then\u00a0probably no one will be coming to your website for the target search query.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy should i care about organic traffic from Google?\r\nThe answer is simple, its free and targeted. Let me explain each point in detail:\r\n\r\n \tFree traffic: Since you are not paying to drive traffic to your website, people are finding your website on the platform of Google and coming to your website. You don't have to spend any money to drive those visitors to your website\r\n \tTargeted traffic: This is very important. If your website is about selling guitars, but the people coming to your website are interested in buying a mobile phone, then no one will stay on your website for long. When people are coming to your website from Google, they are searching for something that your website has to offer and hence when they land on your website they are more likely to purchase what you have to offer. Google only ranks those website to a particular search query that has content related to that search term\r\n\r\nWhenever someone has a website, the most important metric is the traffic your website gets. The more the traffic, the more money you will make, whatever be the niche you are in. If you are not utilizing the power of Google then most probably you are missing out on a big opportunity\r\nWho are you to explain about Adult search engine optimization, are you an expert or Guru?\r\nLet me clear everything first, I am no guru or an SEO expert. But I have been building websites for almost 7 years now (5 years in the adult industry) and the majority of my traffic comes from Google for almost 20+ websites I have (making me more than $10,000\/month). I love to learn and hence have learned from the experts in the SEO industry, I have purchased many expensive SEO courses to learn as well. Also, all the techniques I will be mentioning later are being performed on my websites as well, hence I can guarantee they work\r\n\r\nHere is a snapshot of one of my website, as you can see approximately 70% of my traffic comes from Google, all this happened just because I followed these SEO techniques\r\n\r\n\r\nOk I am convinced now, start teaching me SEO\r\nGreat lets start with your adult SEO training and how you can also drive enormous adult traffic for your adult website. Here are the Goals of SEO:\r\n\r\nAnd how do we do this: Google looks at what is on the website, Google then looks at the links that are coming into the site, Google then gives certain links more power than others. In a nutshell, the most relevant site with the most powerful adult backlinks coming in wins the race and is awarded the highest search engine rankings\r\n\r\nThe most important Four points in your Adult SEO campaign will be:\r\n\r\n \tRelevance of the page\r\n \tAuthority of the Domain\r\n \tAuthority of Inbound links\r\n \tRelevance of inbound links\r\n\r\nLets Go through each point one by one\r\nRelevance of the page\r\nThis comes under on-page Adult SEO. This basically is how relevant the page you are trying to rank is with the search query. The points that matter are:\r\n\r\n \tTitle of the page: Make sure your target keyword is in the title of the page\r\n \tDescription of the page: Keywords that you are targeting must be in the description of the page\r\n \tThe content of the page: The content must be at least 500 words and properly optimised for the keyword that you are targeting.\r\n \tTitles of the image: Images should have \"ALT TEXT\" which includes the keywords that you are targeting\r\n \tVideos of the page: Having a relevant video increases authority of the post\r\n \tOther On-page factors\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAuthority of the Domain\r\nThis factor is harder to emulate as this cannot be done overnight. It takes the time to build domain authority (DA). A number of factors affect domain authority such as:\r\n\r\n \tThe links pointing to the domain name\r\n \tThe number of unique high-quality SEO optimised pages\/posts on your website\r\n \tSocial factors (social traffic, CTR (click-through rates) and other social signals)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAuthority of Inbound links\r\nThis is one of the most important factors and we will be covering this in detail throughout the post. Adult backlinks are the key factors that will help your website rank higher and push your website in front of thousands of people. There are many blackhat ways to build thousands of adult backlinks within one day, but all that will do to your website is get penalized. The most important thing is to make high-quality adult backlinks. Focus on Quality vs Quantity. When it comes to the authority of links, following points should be kept in mind:\r\n\r\n \tInbound links or the backlink to your website\r\n \tPower of the pages where are inbound link is present\r\n \tPower of the domain where the inbound adult backlink is present\r\n\r\nRelevance of inbound links\r\nThis factor has always be ignored by most of the webmasters that are struggling with getting their websites ranked higher in Google. If your website is about selling Guitars, but majority of your adult backlinks are coming from websites that are totally unrelated to guitars like Dog food, computer peripheral etc, then the power of that backlink\u00a0is significantly reduced. You would want the adult backlinks to come from related domain niche, such as guitar training, guitar schools etc. Relevancy is the key to high quality adult backlinks\r\n\r\nThese were the top four factors that you need to consider before going forward with your adult seo training and building high quality adult backlinks. I have \u00a0list of four amazing SEO tools, that will help you improve SEO of your website, they are trusted by millions of people, and are considered to be the best tools by SEO experts:\r\n\r\n \tMajestic SEO (Accurate and Simple):\r\n \tMOZ (Best representation of Authority)\r\n \tAhrefs (most links counted, but sadly a paid tool)\r\n \tSEMrush (similar tool with great power) (SEMRUSH Coupon Free Pro Account for 14 days Worth $150)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe two key tools we will be using are:\r\nMajestic SEO\r\nTrust Flow and Citation Flow are calculated. Trust flow is the best representation of authority of the\u00a0website. You must be targeting websites that have a Trust Flow and Citation flow with a ration of 1:1, this indicates that the website is high quality. You would also want the trust flow to be at least 10.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nMoz Ratings\r\nFirst, i will recommend you to install the Moz bar.\u00a0\u00a0Domain authority and page authority are good measures when coupled with Trust\u00a0flow to get the profile and authority of any website\r\n\r\nNote: Moz misses a lot of adult backlinks and hence the number of adult backlinks and the sources of these adult backlinks will not be the complete profile, fo that i will recommend using Majestic and Ahrefs\r\n\r\nBefore continuing further, let me tell about one few more important tips and tricks that you can use to optimize your post and website\r\nBasic SEO adult website set up\r\nYou must install \"Yoast SEO\" plugin for your website and it will automatically tell you how to optimise your page is. Let me first also cover other important on-page adult SEO factors that you need to focus on. I have written guides on many of them and I highly recommend to go check them out:\r\n\r\n \tBuying SEO friendly adult domain name,\u00a0How to choose a domain name for your website\r\n \tThe Ultimate Guide Reduce bounce rate\r\n \tWordPress plugins that maximize earnings and SEO\r\n\r\nLet me explain\u00a0to you how you can use internal linking to rank pages of your website and how internal linking can easily optimize your website. If you look at the above stated bullet points then those are internal links of other posts on this website. Internal linking is a great way of passing link juice between pages.Here is an image to explain this better:\r\n\r\nBy creating relevant pages or supporting pages and then pointing to the main page you are trying to rank is a great way of adult seo. In this image, the arrows are a representation of from where the link juice is getting transferred to the target pages. If all the pages are pointing to a single page, then it indicates to Google, that this page has something important to offer, also the link juice is getting passed and hence that target page starts to rank higher on search results.\r\n\r\nAdult friendly domain name\r\n\r\nIt is highly recommended to have your focus keyword in your domain name. Google gives special ranking benefits to such websites. Although this feature has been continuously abused by people, but I have been doing the same for my new websites and its still working. Try not to make the domain name exact as the focus keyword, rather add a helping word to avoid getting blacklisted\r\n\r\nHigh Quality content\r\n\r\nI have stressed on this point multiple times, because this is one of the most important area of your website. In this highly competitive worked of online websites, t be able to stand out of the crowd you need to offer enormous value to the reader from your website. A website visitor has many options when he is looking for some information, for him\/her to become a fan of your website you need to give him exactly what he wants and even more.\r\n\r\nHere are some pointers to keep in mind\r\n\r\n \tThe content must be unique\r\n \tDated articles must be updated. Things change everyday, so a 1-year-old article might not be useful today, so update it with relevant information.\r\n \tMake it an easy read. Use friendly and engaging language. Add media (pictures, videos, gifs etc.) to elaborate and explain in a much better way\r\n \tAdd articles on a regular basis. A regularly updated website is crawled multiple times by Google and given preference in search engine rankings\r\n \tInterlinking relevant articles. Give them a reason to stay long. Interlink articles on your website so that the visitor stays for a much longer time.\r\n \tDon\u2019t write small 200-300 words articles. Try to write at least 600 words in each article. (Note: Do not add irrelevant information if your article is of lesser words, always remember add as much value as possible.\r\n\r\nAdult Seo optimizing your article or post\r\n\r\nAfter writing your high quality article\/post, you need to optimize it for search engines. I hope you are using WordPress CMS for your website. Install\u00a0Yeast SEO\u00a0and try to get green light. Follow all the recommendations it says and fulfill them all. This plugin alone will help you a lot in you on-site adult seo optimization\r\n\r\nLeverage the visitor for Seo and more traffic\r\n\r\nA high quality article which can have a positive affect on the visitor if more likely to be shared by him\/her. So make a call-to-action in order to make him share the article on social media platforms. Commenting on the articles can also help a lot\r\n\r\nSubmitting the Sitemap to Google\r\n\r\nUsing Google Webmaster to submit the sitemap. Google webmaster will be your got place for chaching your website ranking on Google- the leading search engine.\r\n\r\nGenerate the sitemap of your WordPress website using this plugin :\u00a0BWP sitemap\r\n\r\nAdding keyword rich site title and tagline\r\n\r\nAdding the focus keyword of your niche or website in site title also helps in seo benefits and is a good seo strategy. Add relevant additional important keywords in site tagline\r\n\r\nAdding Alt tags to images\r\n\r\nAny image you upload to your website can be adult seo optimized by adding the focus keyword of that article\/post as alt tag of the image. This will help drive additional traffic from image search engines. Also this will improve overall seo score of the article\/post\r\n\r\nKeyword friendly Article\/post Permalink\r\n\r\nHaving the focus keyword in the urn of your articles is also very important. So make sure that the keyword you are targeting is shown in the url structure of your articles\r\n\r\nHighlighting or making the keywords bold\r\n\r\nMake sure to highlight, italic or bold the keywords in your articles to get that extra seo benefit\r\n\r\nWebsite speed is a very important parameter\r\n\r\nI have already written articles on this topic check them out here:\u00a0Speed up adult Website\r\n\r\nDo not miss this step. This is highly critical; a fast loading website is given special preference over a slow website. Also I saw a jump in multiple website rankings when I improved the speed of my website\r\n\r\nTip: Try to get the Data Center, or your server close to the country where majority of your traffic is coming from. For example, if 80% of your traffic is coming from United States, then getting a US server will be extremely beneficial.\r\nRookie mistakes, beginner seo mistakes, newbie seo mistakes, and SEO traps to stay away from\r\nLet me cover the mistakes that you can make while doing search engine optimisation of your website. learning from other people's mistakes is the best form of learning and today i will cover exactly what you should not do for your adult website linkbuilding\r\n\r\n \tThinking this SEO stuff is so complex and giving up - Dont do that, path to success is not easy my friend\r\n \tBuying links, using black hat methods of linkbuilding, indulging in link farms, link pyramids, etc - Dont even think about these stuff\r\n \tBuilding too many backlinks too quickly - this will alert google about something fishy and you might get a penalty, and trust me recovering from a Google penalty is very tough\r\n \tFocusing on quantity vs quality, One high quality backlink is much more powerful than 100 crappy adult backlinks my friend\r\n\r\nHere is an article i wrote that might be helpful:\u00a0Learn from my adult tube website mistakes\r\n\r\nAnother beginner mistake is to not consider the \"Nofollow\" links. Nofollow adult backlinks are those that do point to your website or page, but do not pass the link juice and hence are not considered by Google. Newbies think since they are not helpful to rankings they don't build them, but trust me they are important as well. The trust\u00a0flow metric also considers \"Nofollow\" links to build the authority of the website. Also Google might be alert if the website only has \"doFollow\" links as that might not look natural. Even social signals are all \"nofollow\" links but Google gives weightage for social signals for rankings\r\n\r\nLet me also cover Mobile Responsiveness: Since you all know that the world is shifting to mobile. More and more websites are witnessing an ever increasing mobile users. Facebook themselves have accepted that their mobile users are so many times higher then desktop users. Google has been giving ranking benefits to mobile-friendly websites, by this they mean:\r\n\r\n \tFast loading website on mobile\r\n \tResponsive design, easily adaptable to any mobile screen and hence increased user experience\r\n\r\nYou must have also seen on Google search results that the websites that are optimised for mobile (mobile friendly website theme) has a small \"mobile-friendly\" written along the search result. So make sure the theme of your website is responsive and easily adaptable with every screen size, if you are purchasing a theme from platforms such as Themeforest, then you don't need to worry about it as the developers are making mobile friendly themes now. I witnessed a sudden increase in my traffic on one of my website when i switched to a mobile-friendly them.\r\n\r\nStaying Away from PBN's: PBN (Private blog network) was earlier used by many people to rank their website on Google, it is just like a link farm and total black hat way of gaining SEO rankings. Is is highly unsafe to buy links from PBN's and Link farms. Although many experinced SEO experts know how to use them the right way, but as an amateur SEO person you should stay away from them.\r\nAdult SEO Keywords - Queries, longtail - Get More Organic Traffic\r\nLets discuss over\u00a0Adult SEO Keywords - Queries, longtail - Get More Organic Traffic. Keywords are the most important criteria you choose to optimize the posts that you add to your website. Google checks your website for specific keywords to give a ranking to your website on its search results. Finding, targeting and then optimizing your adult website for the right keyword \u00a0is extremely important\r\nPornhub Keyword tool - Best keyword tool pornhub\r\nif you are searching for pornhub keyword tools then trust me you wont find a genuine product, because there is no such thing as pornhub keyword tool.\r\n\r\nThe best ways to find adult keywords or pornhub keywords is to use tools like Semrush and Ahrefs and then either use their own keyword tools for finding search volume of popular keywords like \"porn\" etc. You can also put the ranking URL (no#1 position) into Ahrefs and then find out about how much organic traffic is driven to this link and which keywords are driving thet traffic.\r\n\r\nPorn seo is not that dificult if you know your tools right and also if you follow this guide diligently.\r\nWhat are Adult SEO keywords?\r\nOne thing you have to understand is that the primary goal of Google is to offer the best and the most relevant article on the first result for any search query. I the end the primary purpose of Google is to provide the information that the person is looking for. If that person is able to find that information in the first link itself, then the purpose of Google is served.\r\n\r\nKeywords are a way google get to know a little about the content of your article. Apart from other adult seo factors, Keywords is like a reflection of your website in the eyes of google.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you website is about Blowjob,\u00a0then queries and keyword such as \"Blowjob videos\"\u00a0is a keyword. You target is to rank on number one spot of search results for this search query.\r\n\r\nFinding the right keywords in not enough, you then need to optimize your website and article according to the keywords you are targeting.\r\nWhat are long tail keywords?\r\nbecause of increased competition on the internet, and thousands of websites being opened in almost every niche, it has become extremely difficult to outrank already established websites for certain keywords. For example, you will find Wikipedia articles on majority of general topics as first search result, and it is extremely difficult to out rank those article, so you have to target the long tail keywords.\r\n\r\nLets say someone is searching for \"blowjob video girl sucking big cock abc studio\", this is an example of long tail keyword. Since with just \"blowjob videos\" ,\u00a0already thousands of website is targeting that keyword because of its high search volume, you can target longtail keywords to get that additional traffic with less competition. The only drawback is that very few people are searching for those queries.But if you have a website where you are selling affiliate products, even few extra sales can make all the difference.\u00a0Also ranking higher for long tail search keywords is comparatively much easier.\r\nOptimizing your website for keywords and internal linking ?\r\nYou will have to think like the person searching the query. What is going on in their mind when they are making a query on Google.\r\n\r\nPeople generally search for pornstar names, or the studio names that are producing these porn videos. So adding internal links to the tag or category page of these porn stars or studios from each individual post will drive them higher in search rankings.\r\n[Complete guide] Keyword Research For Adult websites\r\nKeyword Research Adult sites or finding adult keywords, one of the most crucial and important step, which decides\u00a0your success in making money online through adult websites.

I will be covering a lot of ways and methods on how you can start linkbuilding for your adult website. Let me first give you the pros and cons of adult backlink building:\r\n\r\nHere are the advantages you already have:\r\n\r\n \tLow competition:\u00a0Compared to other normal websites, adult websites are comparatively easier to rank because competition is way less.\r\n\r\nHere is the disadvantage you have:\r\n\r\n \tLack of link opportunities: Finding backlink opportunities (especially high quality ones) is extremely difficult. As normal websites do not want to link themselves with adult websites and hence you have limited resources to build adult backlinks\r\n\r\nLet me list down the ways of building a link profile for your website one by one.\r\nMethod 1: Being a link detective\r\nAlthough there are great many ways of link building for normal non-adult websites, but when it comes yo adult the opportunities are very less. One of the best ways to make backlinks is to fist find opportunities by checking the link profiles of your competition.\r\n\r\nStep-1: Make an excel sheet (here you will copy all the links of the places you will be making backlink on later)\r\n\r\nStep-2: Use tools like majestic,\u00a0https:\/\/www.ranksignals.com (free tool) for looking at backlink profile of your competition. For every link check the Trust flow, and Domain authority if you find a good backlink opportunity then copy the link in your excel sheet. You should check the link profile of atleast 8-10 of your competition\r\n\r\nUsing this method alone you will find hundreds of places from where you can build adult backlinks\r\nMethod 2: Using comments and Forums\r\nalthough this method has been heavily used for ages now and hence Google has stopped giving it much relevance. You must not spend much of your time on building comments adult backlinks at least.\r\n\r\nTIP: One very important tip \u00a0i can give you is to not use \"Anchor text' for your adult backlinks when using comments and Forums. Since these links has gotten a negative connotation when it comes to link building, always paste the direct link for the page that you are targeting. Using anchor text will highly increase the chances of Google penalty\r\n\r\nHere is a list of search commands you can use to find relevant comment opportunities:\r\n\r\n \tkeyword \"1 comment\"\r\n \tkeyword \"2 comments\"\r\n \tkeyword \"3 comments\"\r\n \tkeyword \"4 comments\"\r\n \tkeyword disqus\r\n \tkeyword \"leave a comment\"\r\n\r\nFor forums you can use:\r\n\r\n \tkeyword\"forum\"\r\n \tkeyword\"powered by Fireboard\"\r\n \tkeyword\"powered by ip.board\"\r\n \tkeyword\"powered by phpbb\"\r\n \tkeyword\"powered by phpbb3\"\r\n \tkeyword\"powered by SMF\"\r\n \tkeyword\"powered by vbulletin\"\r\n \tkeywordforum\r\n \tkeywordintitle:forum\r\n \tkeywordinurl:forum\r\n\r\nMethod 3: Using link exchanges from relevant websites\r\nYou might have seen this on many adult websites where they list a number of websites in a widget with title \"Our Friends\" . This helps them getting adult backllinks from relevant websites in their niche. You can easily make a list of websites in your domain and contact them though email for link exchange. Make sure no one will link to you if your website traffic is not comparable to the one you are trying to get a link back from.\r\n\r\nTIP: Make sure you check the trust flow and Domain authority of the website you are trying to get a link from. You would not want to link to a website which is spammy or low quality\r\n\r\nI have written an article on this:\u00a0Make Adult backlinks using Link exchange website\r\nMethod 4: Using other not so great methods of link building\r\nThese methods were working great earlier or few years back, but now they don't work that much. But building links through these\u00a0techniques will help you diversify your link profiles and help your link building look more natural. I have written several articles on this:\r\n\r\nThere are many places to build backlinks. First let me give to a checklist of what you must do and must keep in mind\r\n\r\n \tVary your anchor text\r\n \tBuild adult backlinks of all quality (33% low quality, 33% moderate quality, 33% high quality)\r\n \tOnly make maximum of 3-5 adult backlinks in a day\r\n\r\n\r\n \tBest picture dump sites\r\n \tList of Pin porn websites for adult Backlink and Seo\r\n \tBest Porn TGP sites\r\n \tList of Best Free Adult image hosting sites\r\n \tBuild adult backlinks using Who\u2019s That Pornstar sites\r\n\r\nRemember one very important thing. Google has changed its algorithm and now they want the backlink to come from a website that is in the same niche or related niche of your website. So make 50% of your backlinks from the websites that are in your niche.\r\n\r\nAlso check out these articles:\r\n\r\n \tThe trick i use for high quality adult backlinks\r\n \tAvoid Overoptimization \u2013Backlink Building\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nMethod 5: Adding value and getting a link back\r\nThis is more like a smart strategy, also this might not work will all types of adult websites. But this method requires some work from your end hence you will have to do some hardwork but the links you will get are amazing. Let me give you an example, don't you like it when someone helps you without any ill motive or expecting something in return, this is what we will be exploiting in this method. In this method you will be going through the websites in your niche, help the owner of the website in one way or another, and then ask them for a link to your website.\r\n\r\nRemember: If you get a \"Anchor Text\" link well and good, but even if you were able to get a direct url link even that has some power to boost your rankings.\r\n\r\nHere are the steps that you need to follow:\r\n\r\n \tMake a list of all the websites that are in your niche\r\n \tSort the websites in terms of the quality of website and the power of backlink you will get. (use tools such as MOZ and Majestic for ranking the website, you can use the metric of Trust flow to rank the websites)\r\n \tStart going through each website and look for any one of the following\r\n\r\n \tBroken links on the website (giving 404 response) (use browser plugins for this)\r\n \tDeleted videos if it is a tube website (make a list of at least 50 of the deleted videos on that website)\r\n \tIf the content is outdated, and you have the knowledge of updated content\r\n \tIf the website is extremely slow or the user experience is pathetic\r\n \tAny other type of value that you can add to the website owner\r\n\r\n\r\n \tDo the above steps for as many websites as you can , also make sure you keep a column for contact information (either contact form url or if direct email is available)\r\n \tDraft an email and add the value in your email and send it to each website.\r\n \tOnce the website owner sees the email and thanks you for helping him, you can then tell them about your website and how it is related to the same niche as their website. 9 times out of 10, they will be happy to link back to your website.\r\n\r\nThe motive here is to help other person first and then ask for something in return. By adding value first you were able to win his trust and then he\/she will be highly likely to link back to you. Just make sure the link is \"dofollow\".\r\nMethod 6: Sponsored Posts or Paying money for links\r\nSponsored posts should be your last tactic of link building. Let me also tell you that they come under BlackHatways of adult backlilnks building since we are paying to get our links on other peoples website. If you read earlier in this article i asked you to stay away from buying links (i was talking about PBN's and link farms) , \u00a0but sponsored posts are still a safer and more effective method that buying links because they are real, active , clean sites that just happen to make money from advertisers (Just like Inc, Forbes etc)\r\n\r\nNote 1: This method can get expensive, generally depending on the quality of the website, you might have to pay in between ($30-$300) per post, but mostly in ~$100 range. Worry not i will tell you about negotiation techniques\r\n\r\nNote 2: Make sure you do extensive research on the quality of the link - make sure that it is not a link farm.\r\n\r\nOur goal will be to look for websites that are looking for a monetization method, and hence by offering them some money in exchange of a Link is mutual benefit. So make an excel sheet and fill it with websites that are related in your niche - blogs, tubes, etc. Also make sure you make a column for contacting them either through contact form, but email is preferred\r\n\r\nBefore contacting them do the following checks:\r\n\r\n \tDomain authority and Trust flow\r\n \tContent quality(are they indulging in spamming)\r\n \tDo they \u00a0\"nofollow\" the sponsored post or not\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNegotiating the price: Keep one thing in mind, that the person you are contacting need the money more than you think. So tell them honestly that the prices they are asking is out of your budget and then give them a reason why they should lower the price. 9 times out of 10 they will come up with a lower price.\r\n\r\nI understand that the number of websites wont be large as the niche is adult in nature, but you also have to understand that since the competition is not that high, even few links will be really helpful in driving the rankings of your website high up in the search engines\r\n\r\nOther tips:\r\n\r\nGetting adult backlinks from Websites and Blogs\u00a0\r\n\r\nOne most important thing to keep in mind is, get links from website which are in your niche. Relevant websites are the only ones that you must be targeting for your backlinks.\r\n\r\nHere are the steps:\r\n\r\n \tMake a list of websites in your niche. (These are your competitors)\r\n \tEmail them through their contact form about your website and how both can benefit from link trade\r\n \tSince the websites are on same niche and targeting the same keywords, the strength of the backlink will be huge\r\n \tUsually a link is placed in the right widget or footer as \"friends of xyz.com\"\r\n\r\nRemember if you are just starting out then don\u2019t expect the big players in your niche to link to you. The best way is to target the website who are almost equivalent to your level of traffic\r\n\r\nGetting social media links\r\n\r\nGoogle has mentioned that they give some weightage to social signals. So if your articles or posts are getting shared on the social media platforms a lot, then this will directly help you in seo rankings in search engine results.\r\n\r\nYou can automate this process by using a website like Hootsuite.com. Also there are plugins which automatically post your recently published article automatically to your social media accounts.\r\n\r\nAlso make sure to add Call-to-action, asking your website readers to share your content on social media platforms. Remember people will only share content they loved. This will only happen when you write high quality content in your website\r\n\r\nOne problem you might face is that not all social media platforms allow adult contend. The ones that do is\r\n\r\n \tTumblr\r\n \tReddit\r\n \tTwitter\r\n\r\nFor other platforms like Facebook, be wary of the guidelines and post only stuff that will not get you banned.\r\n\r\nAdult Directories and link pyramids\r\n\r\nIf you have followed my other adult seo guides for porn sites, then you know how much I hate these spammy link building techniques. Google will instantly blacklist your website when they find your website indulging in this shady blackhat ways of backlinks building. Instead of helping you in SEO they will negatively affect your website rankings\r\n\r\nEven if you spot an adult directory in your niche, prefer quality over quality. Stay away from spammy adult directories.\r\n\r\nUsing email list for adult backlinks building and adult seo\r\n\r\nEmail list is a critical tool if you are an adult performer (clip store studio owner or camming model). If you own an adult tube website, then creating a mailing list wont really help you a lot.\r\n\r\nEmail list can be utilized in several ways\r\n\r\n \tBuilding stronger relationships with your followers\r\n \tAdding more value to your subscribers\r\n \tCreating a community, which is an essential part of a website\r\n \tAn available audience to promote anything\r\n\r\n \tDon\u2019t misuse this feature. First add a lot of value in their life, and only then you can request them or drive them to something that you want for yourself\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo how can you do adult seo using email list?\r\n\r\nYou can give a freebie (like and eBook or any other thing) in exchange of asking them to share your content on their social networks. You can even create a content locker, where the content will only be available when someone follows certain stenos like\r\n\r\n \tLiking on Facebook Page\r\n \tFollowing on twitter\r\n \tSharing the article on their twitter timeline\r\n\r\nMost important TIP: It is very important that you spend quite some time on Adult SEO and link building. Initially I thought that i will add some high quality content and easily organic traffic will start flowing in my website. I was wrong, you need to build a link profile, and indulge in adult seo if you are serious about your website and want to make some significant income from them\r\n\r\nHere is a video of Brian Dean, the ultimate SEO expert:\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope you like this article on\u00a0The Advanced Guide to Adult SEO and Backlinks.\r\nLearn Adult SEO Understanding SEO for Adult Webmasters\r\nThe videos are distributed by Google itself, so this gives us guarantee that it works. high quality Google Webmaster videos on their YouTube channel, is the ultimate source of understanding Search engine optimization\r\n\r\nMost of the ideas feature Matt Cutts, One of Google's software engineer.

Although the methods remain the same, but not all the websites accept adult content thereby creating a problem for adult webmasters.\r\n\r\nIf you witness a sudden drop in your website visitors or traffic, then you might have suffered from a Google penalty. It is extremely hard to recover from a penalty, hence i advise you to follow some guidelines to prevent yourself in the first place\r\n\r\nHowever sometimes, unaware people indulge in SEO over optimization and suffer from Google penalties and losing all the visitors and hardwork.This article will cover the best practices to follow so that you are safe and immune from any Google penalties and get quality search engine rankings.\r\n\r\nAdult SEO is a complicated game and one needs to learn by trial and error what works and what doesn't. Both on-page and off-page factors are considered by Google's spiders when crawling a website.I will be listing down some key points, which i have learned over years of being into adult industry. Follow these SEO practices:\r\n\r\n1) Do not use black hat or any other unscrupulous adult link building techniques\r\n\r\n2) Avoid keyword stuffing, or rather do not overdo it (on post, page and domain)\r\n\r\n3) Keep the keyword density below 7%\r\n\r\n4) Stay away from duplicate content, write your own original high quality content\r\n\r\n5) Do not ever link to spam websites, link farms, or any other shady place of link exchange. Few quality backlinks are worth more than thousands of worthless links\r\n\r\n6) Avoid grammatical errors, spelling mistakes in your content\r\n\r\n7) Never try to trick or fool the search engines, sooner or later it will backfire\r\n\r\n8) Do not try to make thousands of adult backlink on a daily basis, link building should look natural and hence devote one hour everyday and only make quality backlinks. As the website starts getting more traffic then you can increase the number of links you make per day. It is all about looking natural in the eyes of Google\r\n\r\n9) Do not waste your time building no-dofollow backlinks, as they wont be considered by Google for ranking your website\r\n\r\n10) Do not buy gigs from Fiverr or Seoclerks, which promise tens of thousands of backlinks in few days. You will lose both the money and your website rankings\r\n\r\nWhen a search engine websites crawls a website, it looks at many different parameters to rank your website in comparison to others in your competition. If you follow quality SEO methods then sooner or later you will start ranking higher for your chosen focus keyword.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nPorn SEO trick that worked for me\r\nI don't know why it works but it has been giving me tremendous results for last three years. I found this trick by chance. This gives my website initial attention that you needs of Google. When you just start your website its very difficult to get noticed. There are already many established websites in your niche and they are the ones that get recommended by google in the search results.\r\n\r\nThese beginning days of you website are the most difficult once. You barely get traffic and you do everything to increase it to a acceptable level.\r\n\r\nOnce when i was creating a tube website, instead of focusing on building backlinks like i used to do, i just started doing tube uploads with branding to let the people come back to my website. What this did was people started typing the domain name of my website on Google and then traffic started pouring in. The best part about this traffic was that since the traffic is targeted , the bounce rate was only close to 20-25%. That must have given a strong indication to Google that this website has something of great value to offer.\r\n\r\nOnce i stopped my tube uploads, i could see that i started ranking for related keywords in my niche without even building any backlinks.\r\n\r\nSo, just because people came to my website after searching my domain name on Google and stayed there for a very long time, that helped me in my Adult SEO a lot. I am not sure why this trick works, or the reason i am assuming is right or wrong, i just know it works. Let me show you a screenshot of what i am trying to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs you can see, after tube uploads i saw a great influx of traffic and within a week in my Google Webmaster i could see many search queries for which i was ranking at not so bad positions.\r\n\r\nLegal disclaimer: This article is for information only.

The reason being why send your precious hard earned visitors to some other website when those valuable visitors can be channelized to give you much more ROI (Return on Investment) when they visit your own website.\r\n\r\n \tFirstly there are chances that the visitor might get irritated by going to some other website, so there is a high probability of loosing a repeat visitor.\r\n \tSecondly you never know, that one particular visitor might end up buying a affiliate product or joining a Cam sight that you are promoting and thereby earning you much more than what you were earning through mobile-redirects\r\n \tThirdly and most importantly, google has started penalizing websites with mobile redirects, so if you are ready to lose only SEO advantage then its your call in the end\r\n\r\nIf you are one of those stubborn person and thinks that what i say is crap, then you may try this ad platform for yourself. Or if you have loads of traffic but not making much money from conventional advertisements then you may try mobile-redirect ad platform. The best network that provides the best rates for mobile redirect ads is Plugrush\u00a0\r\nPinterest like Porn Pinning\/Sharing websites for adult seo\r\nIf you are also tired of searching google about SEO for adult websites or a list of porn pinning websites with not even a single blog or website that can guide you on how to rank a adult website on #1 position on google.

This website is a way to pass my knowledge and leanings to all the people who wants to earn some passive income. I have a network or almost 20 adult websites which make more than $10,000 per month. This includes adult websites, webcam models, clipstore models, porn production etc etc. If you have a willingness to earn some extra cash then do take each article seriously and get up off your lazy ass and start taking some action.
