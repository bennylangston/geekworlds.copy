I know we are humans and 40% looks huge but that industry average. Other not so popular clip sites might offer you a better share like 70% of your revenue, but that is because they are not as big as clips4sale.

These smaller clipsites sometimes even allow you to sell clips with your watermark of clips4sale on it.</p><p>Note: If you are uploading your clips on multiple clip sites, then keep the title, description, price same, otherwise a customer might buy a clip only to find out that its one of the same clip he bought someplace else.</p><p><strong>Understanding the Percentage share or your cut on the clips you sell:</strong></p><p>You percentage share depends on many factors:</p><ol><li>Clipsite</li><li>Demographic or audience of that clipsite</li><li>Niche or categories it caters to</li><li>Few other factors</li></ol><p>Industry average is you as a clip producer getting 60% share.

If it is a country specific website then your cut might be even lower</p><p><strong>Why not I start my own website and keep 100% of revenue:</strong></p><p>Yes, you can but creating  a website looks very simple, but it is highly complex. You can easily create a website for yourself. But promoting it, getting payment processor, getting it in front of your target audience will lead you spending tons of your precious time on this particular thing. You could easily spend this time creating more clips and be happy with the 60% revenue you get.</p><p>The biggest problem is that it is an adult niche. So major payment processors won&#8217;t accept you and the alternatives are expensive and not worth the time.</p><p><strong>Advantages of using a clipsite clipstore for selling clips are:</strong></p><ol><li>They give you a ready-made platform</li><li>Targeted audience (The most important reason)</li><li>Free promotion, marketing (Again a very expensive area)</li><li>Hosting your videos, bandwidth, customer support (all this is expensive)</li><li>Payment processing capability</li><li>Keeping you away from the hassle of technical stuff and keeping you focused on the most important job &#8211; Producing clips and keeping the customer happy</li><li>Email List management : A vital tool for promotion</li></ol><h2>How To Become A Top Selling clips4sale Studio</h2><p>This is the first question that comes into everyone&#8217;s mind when they start aa s aclips4sale clip stores studio owner.

This article on <strong>ClipLength Guide clips4sale</strong> will cover everything about the length of the clips you upload. For a beginner or a newbie, it might be confusing as clips4sale has a little complex system. Although it sounds very trivial that its just clip length what could be wrong with it, but one must know the clips4sale guidelines on uploading the clips.</p><p>If you have a slow internet connection and then you upload your clip only to find out that the video has been rejected by clips4sale for some reason, it&#8217;s frustrating.</p><p><strong>Category 1 : 2 minutes to 19 minutes clips</strong></p><p>On clips4sale, a clip changes its minute at 00:45 mark. i.e. 15:48 is 16 minutes and 15:44 is 15 minutes</p><p>Also, the size of the clips in this category must be less than 1GB</p><p><strong>Category 2: 20 minutes to 29 minutes</strong></p><p>Here the clip size must be less than 1.2 GB. Although you will find many clips on the clipstores  of others that are in between this range of clip length but still the size is significantly large. So there are exceptions, but why to try something like this and follow the rules.</p><p><strong>Category 3 &#8211; 30 minutes and more</strong></p><p>The file size of such clips need to be less than 2 GB, but then again you can find exceptions to this rule as well.</p><p>While you are about to hit the export button on your software you will get an estimate of the size o the clip, so keep it within the clips4sale guidelines.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How to store all the files? (Raw videos, statistics, customer data etc.</strong></h2><p>Buying a two terabyte hard disk is a must if you own a clips4sale clip stores studios. You need to keep your data safe, so making two copies also helps to protect the data in case one hard disk crashes or gets corrupted.</p><p>Naming the files is also important. You should follow one naming convention so that it is easy for you to find. Proper folder structure with dates and tags to remind you about the clips.</p><p>Sometimes you need to visit the old content, as you might be thinking of making a compilation video. Or more like an upgraded version of previous clips, or maybe like a series of part-1, part2 etc.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong> Offline advertisements, and how to master it, should a clips4sale clip stores studio focus on external/offline advertisements</strong></h2><p>Although this is a very debatable topic, but the balance goes on to social media for some and for some it&#8217;s another method.</p><p>Although you can go for paid advertisements, but you have to remember that these cips4sale clipstore clips are not that expensive. And also clips4sale take a 40% cut in that, so the money you spent for each clip sale and the income you make is very hard to balance and see a significant positive difference</p><p>But trend has shown that majority of clips4sale studios have seen maximum sales through social media channel</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How to handle piracy in clips4sale clipstore studio clips?</strong></h2><p>It is a very personal choice for you. First, you will have to understand one very important fact that</p><p>The majority of the free tube websites who upload your content, their audience are free loaders. Almost all of them love free content and they will never pay for your clips.</p><p>Another thing to consider is that some studios take this as free publicity. You get exposure on various other websites as your clips are being uploaded. So, in the end, its very personal choice of you to handle it or not.</p><p>Handling piracy is very easy, all you have to do is find the DMCA page on the tube website. Every tube website has a DMCA page. That page has all the steps that you need to take in order to get your clip removed from their website. Generally, these are the steps that you need to follow:</p><ol><li>an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright or other intellectual property interest;</li><li>description of the copyrighted work or another intellectual property that you claim has been infringed</li><li>a description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the SITE, must include the specific URL&#8217;s associated with each file</li><li>your address, telephone number, and email address;</li><li>a statement by you that you have a good-faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and,</li><li>a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your Notice is accurate and that you are the copyright or intellectual property owner or authorized to act on the copyright or intellectual property owner’s behalf.</li></ol><p>Finding the websites which are pirating your content is also very easy. Just google your studio&#8217;s name, and sort the result by &#8220;last month&#8221;, &#8220;last week&#8221; or &#8220;last year&#8221; and send the notice to all of them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What is the list of best Hardware, software, to use for opening clips4sale clip store studio?</strong></h2><p>I will be writing a detailed article on this topic very soon. Keep checking back, or bookmark this post</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Having breast/boob implants help in getting more sales on clips4sale</strong> <strong>clipstore studio?</strong></h2><p>The answer is very easy. Definitely yes. I am not saying that it works for everyone. It is just that you have to find your differentiating factor. Being a clips4sale clipstore model/studio owner, you need to find your unique selling point in the crowd. The competition is immense and for gaining a loyal and paying fan base you need to be unique.</p><p>Everyone has some unique trait that they can capitalize upon. You just have to find that. for egg:</p><ol><li>You might have very large feet</li><li>Naturally redhead</li><li>You voice is remarkable</li><li>Any other body feature which no one else has</li><li>Racial and ethnic background</li><li>You dressing style</li></ol><p>These are just a few, you can position yourself in many other ways. You have to find it and make money off it by highlighting that feature as much as possible</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Does collaboration with other clips4sale clipstore models/studio help in clipsales?</strong></h2><p>This is a very lucrative area. It can be tremendously helpful for you if done right. Make sure who you are working with is professional and knows what she is doing. You can pay them or do a content trade arrangement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Does working in Mainstream Porn movies help in increasing the clips4sale</strong> <strong>clipstore clipsales?</strong></h2><p>I have talked to much successful clips4sale clipstore models/studio owners, who did not see any significant increase in clipsales even after signing a deal with some major players in the porn industry.</p><p>Definitely, it provides you exposure and free marketing, but in terms of more clipsales, it does not translate to that.</p><p>I will not lead to doubling your clip4sale clip store clip sales.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What are the best offline Promotion tactics to use?</strong></h2><p>Social media has worked great for many clipstore studios so I will talk about that. Engaging <strong>everyday </strong>on Facebook, twitter, Instagram, Tumblr are a must. You should also be active on Fetish Forums in your category/niche.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I hope this article Clipstore Clips4sale Tips ,Tricks have helped you gain some new knowledge, keep reading for more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Updating your clips4sale clipstore studio. How important is that</strong></h2><p>I have stressed this multiple times, but the sure shot way of success inclips4sale is to update your studio multiple times a day. I hope you have gone through all the articles on this website in our clips4sale/clipstore category. I request you to go through each one of them. Every article has a ton of free knowledge.</p><p>The majority of your traffic will come from clips4sale website itself. Updating your store makes you visible in the front page for some time, that will directly send you visitors and hence making more sales.</p><p>There are many techniques on how you can update you store more often without producing actual clips. I have shared that on other articles. So please check out all articles in this category to be able to make more money and become more successful</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Showing your face in clips4sale clipstore clips? how important is that</strong></h2><p>Not showing your face will directly be a big disadvantage for you. No customer wants to see just the nude parts without any face. You cannot satisfy them only 50%, and expect to make them happy. The face is everything.</p><p>Yes, I understand that showing your faces in clips where you are getting nude might be a little scary thinking about your privacy. But trust me this is a sure shot way of a disaster of your clips4sale clipstore studio/career. There are many other ways you can protect your identity:</p><ol><li>Doing makeup</li><li>Wearing props like wigs</li><li>Adding glasses on our face</li><li>Wearing unconventional costumes</li></ol><p>Above two points in itself can alter your appearance and make you look like a totally different person.</p><p>Make sure to not brag about your profession/sales/money you made to your friends or to your family. That is the only thing that can create a havoc in your life</p><p>Getting naked or nude in a clip is also not 100% essential. There are many categories where you can be successful without getting naked. Fro e.g.: Mina Thorne in dominatrix</p><p>You must understand one thing, that nudity always helps. In the end, people/your customers are buying the clips to jerk off. Nudity alleviates that mood and helps them satisfy their urges. If you will see the statistics between nude and nonuse clips, almost always you will see much more sales in clips in which you were naked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Talking on camera in clips4sale clipstore clips</strong></h2><p>This is one of the common problems with newbies/rookies/newcomers on clips4sale. They don&#8217;t know how and what to talk about on the camera.</p><p>Honestly, the only solution to this is to do more clips. It comes with practice. Some tips from my end would be:</p><ol><li>Start describing what you are doing. Tell them what you see. Tell them how you are feeling</li><li>Slow it down. Don&#8217;t be in a hurry to complete the clip. Everyone loves slow steady actions</li><li>Describe everything while performing slowly</li><li>Watch videos of other clip store owners in your category to find exactly how they are talking to the camera.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Dominatrix/Ridicule category clips4sale</strong></h2><p>Not everyone is well suited for every category. Someone is good in one category but might not be as good in some other category. I know that Dominatrix/Ridicule has become a very popular niche fetish and everyone has started making clips in that. If you are not comfortable making such clips, then don&#8217;t feel disappointed. You can make equal amount of money in some other category in which you are comfortable and love to perform</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Do multiple stores help in clip sales on clips4sale clipstore?</strong></h2><p>Yes, definitely, but you also have to consider the workload that just got doubled. There are two ways to look at this.</p><ol><li>You can make a separate store, put in the hard work and effort to set it up and do everything to get it as successful as the first one. The advantages with the second store will be:<ol><li>You already know what works, so the time you spent on the first store for learning what works and what doesn&#8217;t is easily cut off</li><li>you already have a fan following, so the initial launch of your new store will have great traffic</li></ol></li><li>The other option is to start producing double the clips in the first store. Growing an already established company is easier than building a new company and then growing it.</li></ol><p>Fro the first option, you might be creating a new store because the category is totally unrelated and your current fan base might not be ale to relate to it. so you can decide to create a new store.</p><p>Creating multiple stores also do not mean you start 7-10 stores thinking that you will be handle everything. Trust me this is a recipe for disaster. This way you will be driving your attention in 7-10 parts and nothing will work.</p><p>Focus on 2-3 stores at maximum, and try to increase the traffic of each one of them. In the end it&#8217;s all about the number of updates you can put without compromising the quality of the clips</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Creating similar videos for clips4sale clipstore studio</strong></h2><p>If you are in a category where changing the environment or the very act itself is very difficult. Let&#8217;s say anything related to oral, tongue. Then adding the variety or something new in the new clips you upload will be difficult. But that is something that might be bothering you.</p><p>For someone who has a fetish for that, he will be happy with the new clips even with very few changes. He loves that fetish for a reason, and even small changes like moaning, wig, and lipstick color, smile, etc. can have the same impact on him</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What is the best filming time/day for a clips4sale clipstore studio/model?</strong></h2><p>It depends totally on you. If you are giving your full time to clips4sale, then try to produce as many clips as possible but while being smart. Creating new content and updating your store regularly is the sure shot way for success. You must update your store with a new clip at least once a day. If you have multiple studios, then each studio should be updated with a new clip at least once a day.</p><p>Also, try to make longer clips as they will give you maximum revenue. (clip length directly proportional to the clip price)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2></h2><h2><strong>Uploading recorded cam shows on clips4sale clip store</strong></h2><p>I do not recommend this method. Many studio owner does this to make money with minimum effort. The majority of your customer’s dislike recorded cam shows being uploaded. Recorded cam shows are just like telling your consumers that you want to make some quick bucks with minimum effort so you uploaded those instead. Always focus on</p><p>Always focus on hard work and quality. Honestly, I have seen that making money on lcips4sale as a clipstore owner is much more than that of as a camming model/webcam model.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Best Video Editing Software for Clips4sale Clip store studio video production</strong></h2><p>I personally love Adobe Premiere Pro. But then again its a very expensive software, and takes some time to learn.</p><p>One great solution if you are not able to afford such expensive product is to join Adobe Creative Cloud. This is more like a renting service, where you will get every Adobe software for just a few dollars per month. So in the beginning phase of your journey when you are not making some serious cash, then you can join this and pay monthly fees while enjoying the benefits of such amazing products</p><p>You also don&#8217;t need to be connected to the internet for it to work, you can easily use it offline.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Does YouTube help in promotion of clips4sale clipstore studio</strong></h2><p>Honestly, sooner or later you will be shut down. Being an adult model, you will be looked at with shady eyes and this could result in your channel getting shut.</p><p>Also, if your videos are regularly getting flagged that also leads to getting your YouTube account banned.</p><p>So you can try, but it did not work in my case</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Time it takes for making clips4sale a main source of income</strong></h2><p>This question has no absolute answer. The dollar figure differs for everyone. Some factors that impact this are:</p><ol><li>Growing the fan base: Producing quality clips regularly, interviews, appearances, more and more promotion</li><li>Producing good quality clips, and updating the store every day</li><li>Following all the tips and advice shared with you on this website</li><li>Being Smart: This is something that cannot be taught. Following the trends, what’s working, what’s selling and then creating clips in that niche.</li><li>One point that you can&#8217;t do much about &#8211; Luck</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What is the dollar figure that can help me get in Top 50 studios?</strong></h2><p>Generally earning close to $250 per day will get you in the Top-50 studios.  But that needs to be consistent, not just a one-day sales figure</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Opening Multiple Stores and Linking them together on clips4sale</strong></h2><p>The answer is YES, you can open multiple stores and link them as well. If you have the same payment information for all the stores you own, then you will receive one payment instead of multiple payments for each studio.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How can you Post a link in your store that leads to all your clips in a certain category?</strong></h2><p>Here is a screenshot of how you can achieve this:</p><ol><li>Click on Clip store</li><li>List clips</li><li>&#8220;Direct links to store categories&#8221;</li><li>And there you can add the links</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1475" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=" data-lazy-src="http://makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AveKM02.png" alt="How can you Post a link in your store that leads to all your clips in a certain category" width="935" height="302" data-lazy-srcset="http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AveKM02.png 935w, http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AveKM02-300x97.png 300w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 935px) 100vw, 935px"/><noscript><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1475" src="http://makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AveKM02.png" alt="How can you Post a link in your store that leads to all your clips in a certain category" width="935" height="302" srcset="http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AveKM02.png 935w, http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AveKM02-300x97.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 935px) 100vw, 935px"/></noscript> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1476" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=" data-lazy-src="http://makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/mrVyFCg.png" alt="How can you Post a link in your store that leads to all your clips in a certain category" width="696" height="556" data-lazy-srcset="http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/mrVyFCg.png 696w, http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/mrVyFCg-300x240.png 300w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"/><noscript><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1476" src="http://makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/mrVyFCg.png" alt="How can you Post a link in your store that leads to all your clips in a certain category" width="696" height="556" srcset="http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/mrVyFCg.png 696w, http://www.makemoneyadultcontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/mrVyFCg-300x240.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"/></noscript></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Converting Videos on MAC, which software:</strong></h2><p>You can use FLV Crunch to convert on the MAC.</p><p>Here is the link: <a href="http://download.cnet.com/Flv-Crunch/3000-2194_4-10909295.html">http://download.cnet.com/Flv-Crunch/3000-2194_4-10909295.html</a></p><p>You can convert from many different formats to many different formats</p><h2><strong>How does the email system on Clips4sale Works?</strong></h2><p>Every customer has an option to sign ups for the email list. This is not an automatic thing that a person is automatically subscribed if he/she purchases a clip.</p><p>You can then send them an email about the clip that you want to sell.</p><p>This is a resource that many studios utilize but look at its potential. Whenever you upload a new clip and send them a notification about it, you can get instant sales. Also, the people on the list is targeted, i.e. the people are already interested in that category</p><h2><strong>How to make good sales, get noticed, increase views of my store on clips4sale?</strong></h2><p>I will give a list of points that you must follow:</p><ol><li>Upload as much as you can. Updating your store as often as possible is the best way of making good sales, get noticed, increase views of the store on clips4sale. Updating gives you the benefit of getting featured on recently updated store and that helps in driving traffic back to your store.<ol><li>You will notice that once you stop updating and uploading new videos, your daily sales will drop significantly</li></ol></li><li>Upload to different categories. When you are starting as a beginner/rookie/newbie then you need to find that best category for you. For this you can experiment and see where is your sweet spot. So trying and testing is the only savior you have</li><li>Uploading the same clips in different formats: You can upload the same clips (but of different format) to different categories. You can also schedule them to be updated at different times.<ol><li>Clips4sale Tip: When you upload the same clip in different file format, then go to your first clip listing, click on &#8220;New clip&#8221; at the bottom of the page and a new clip form will open up. This will already have all the field filled up, so you do not have to input everything again</li></ol></li><li>Work with preview image and GIF animation.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Delete and Reload trick Clips4sale</strong></h2><p>Yes, there is a way to delete your old clips and then reupload then to get yourself featured in &#8220;Recently Updated&#8221; category page, the second time for the same clip. But there is a rookie mistake that you can do. You might just delete the clips from &#8220;List Clips&#8221; section and think the clip is deleted.

If you have any other question or query, please ask it in comments section below.</p><h2>Clipstore Marketing and Promotion &#8211; Complete most effective guide</h2><p>Today I will be giving you another long but super effective article on how to do <strong>Clipstore Marketing Promotion &#8211; Complete most effective guide. </strong>Why you joined clips4sale is very obvious &#8211; to make some decent passive income and hoping to make clips4sale the major source of revenue in the future</p><p><em>Clipstore Marketing Promotion &#8211; Clips4sale Free Traffic Generate. We will cover all the tips, tricks, techniques, methods that work for free traffic generation which leads to more sale and more exposure.</em></p><p>You already know that for every sale you make on clips4sale, the company c4s.com take 40% and you are left with 60%. Whenever someone starts a business, the most prominent thing on his mind if to find the exact dollar amount he/she can make in this business, in various stages:</p><ol><li>How much money can I make on clips4sale in my first month</li><li>How much money can I make on clips4sale per month after 6 months</li><li>How much money can I make on clips4sale per month after one year</li></ol><p>Usually one year is the future benchmark one takes to base his decision whether to start in this business or not.</p><p>The Answer to above questions is not absolute, it depends on many factors such as:</p><ol><li>How often you update your clips4sale studio</li><li>How much hard work are you willing to put in</li><li>Are you smart enough to find your differentiating factor to be able to stand out in the crowd and beat your competition</li><li>How fast and How soon can you make solid connection with your audience</li><li>The category you are in</li><li>And most importantly, whether the clips you produce are of good quality or not</li></ol><p>Now for an amateur/rookie/beginner, considering he/she does not have any following, prior expeice, or any connection to big players, he/she can expect to earn between $250-900 per month. This income will increase month on month just like for any other business but will come to a standstill or a downward curve because people are now used to your videos. They have already seen many videos of you and need something new in their life, a new face, (I know it sucks but that’s the harsh reality). But worry not, its a more advanced concept, and I will write an article about it soon.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The range $250-900 per month is not an absolute number, I cannot comment on others making much more than that or even lower than that. That is an average number that I have seen after some experience in this industry</p><p>If you will look the 6 month or 12 months’ earnings curve, you will see an upward movement in the first few months and then a stagnant or maybe even a decline. Then it should/might balance in between.</p><p>There was a common belief that if you are among the top clips4sale studio, then you could make upwards of $30,000 per month. But honestly, this is not true. One of the Famous Clips4sale studios disclosed his income and the figures were like this:</p><p>For a rank #8 on top 50 clips4sale studio, he was making close to $2500 per week.</p><p>For a rank #2 on top 50 clips4sale studios, he was making close to $3,000 per week. Which translates into 3,000&#215;4 = $12,000 per month, which is nowhere close to $30,000 per month.</p><p>One good thing is that as you start producing more clips and experience, you will get to where exactly you can save some time. Let’s say if you are spending 50hrs/week on your clips4sale studio making XXXX dollars per week.  After few months you will easily be making same or more money in just 20-30hrs/week, this is because now you know exactly how you can save up time and become more efficient. This extra saved time can be used to make more money by building websites, other clips4sale studios or camming studio.</p><p>Note: If you think these numbers are not satisfactory and if you are feeling discourages then please don&#8217;t do that. If you are hardworking and smart you can easily make money and there is huge potential for that. You can easily make a comfortable living out of clips4sale</p><p>Some more metrics for you:</p><ol><li>The majority of your clips sale will be in the form of one (1) clip sales. Close to 70% of your total sales</li><li>Around 25% of your total sales will be a 2-3 clip order</li><li>5% of your total sales will be 4 clip orders or more.</li><li>On average 100 visit to your store will give you 1 one sale, and on average one sale is close to $10</li></ol><p>So yes, if you can get targeted visitors to your studio then your sales will increase. Please not these are not absolute numbers, the data is experienced by me and other studios, as also compared with other resources on the internet.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> Do not let one day, one week, or one month affect your mindset. Humans are designed to see instant results, but you will have to look at the bigger picture and long-term average of your studio clipstore.</p><p>Now let&#8217;s talk about an important point. The First month of launching your clip store/Studio:</p><p>You might be all charged up, you have done all the hardwork, uploaded the videos, and did everything that you could learn from this website and other resources on the internet. You might be feeling the rush in your veins of looking at $$$ amount in your admin panel. But at the end of the day, you see zero sales.</p><p>Yes, you will see some hits (visitor traffic) in your admin but you might not see any sale. You might not even see a sale in one week (worst case scenario). But this is the pain period. Not getting disheartened and working without losing hope is the trait of a true champion. Weak hearted people quit because they wanted to get rich quick, they wanted to see instant results, but nothing in this world comes so easy.</p><p>Many studios have wasted their time, uploading the clips4sale mandatory 10 clips and few updates, but when they did not see any sales, they quit.</p><p>One Pro tip I can give you is to: Always focus on adding value to someone, money will automatically come. Don&#8217;t just run after the money, you will never be able to catch it.</p><p>Honestly, initially, you should make realistic goals, enough to cover your daily basic requirements. Don&#8217;t expect to become one among the top 5 studios within a week.</p><p>This is one other reason why o always recommends making videos in a category that you love yourself. Because otherwise you will feel the blow much harder because you already don&#8217;t have any special liking towards the category. You might play the blame game and quit.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> Don&#8217;t become an information junkie. Its a problem majority of people have. Don&#8217;t just absorb everything on the internet thinking that I will take actions later. Read only which is relevant to the moment, absorb it, understand it and take action first. You can never be prepared enough to start, in the end, the people who succeed have the courage to take that first step. Not knowing everything is good.</p><p>Setting realistic goals also help you not loose motivation. If you were targeting $10,000 but you are not getting enough sales even for $1,000 per month then trust me, your mental state will not be healthy and it will directly and adversely impact you.</p><p>Hope you are enjoying this article on Clipstore Marketing Promotion, please read on for more information</p><p>Some Tips you must follow as a Clips4sale Studio Owner:</p><p><strong>Never give a guarantee or 100% promise to your customers:</strong></p><p>You will find customers who will request you to make a certain kind of clip. You might be tempted and agree by giving him a solid confirmation. But that’s where you went wrong. Never give 100% guarantee that you will do exactly as your customer asked you for. Always use the word, you will try to make such clip. That way you would not have the obligation. If you make it, everyone is happy. But if you do not make it you just lost a customer for rife.</p><p><strong>Understanding the difference between a customer and a Fan</strong></p><p>The sooner you realize the difference the sooner it will be beneficial for you. You should treat every visitor who comes to your websites, or any person who buys you clips as <strong>CUSTOMERS. </strong>The reason I say this is because in the end you are selling a product, for which your customer pays and satisfy his needs. You are fulfilling a requirement that your customers have.</p><p>Fans are different, they like or love you for who you are. They will buy the clips irrespective of whether they love the clip or not.</p><p>You should always treat everyone as the customer. Treat your Clips4sale clipstore studio as a business where you are selling a product and people are coming there to buy that product.</p><p><strong>Relationship with your customers</strong></p><p>Yes, when you are in a clipstore studio business type environment you try your best to be as authentic as possible. You show your genuine self so that you a build solid relationships and win the trust of your customers. You try everything to show a good face, produce good quality clips, keep your customer needs in mind, do not indulge in any mal-practice of making money. You go one step ahead and treat every customer as more than a customer and try to create strong bonds by being more personal.</p><p>Here comes the problem, being genuine in your approach is a sure shot way of success, but being personal is the worst way you can do that. For your customers, you are a fantasy, a figure that satisfies their sexual urges. You give them mental peace; whatever way it be.</p><p>When you try to be personal, you reveal too much unnecessary information and you end up destroying that image. Just like if you are a guy, you fantasize about the perfect most gorgeous girl in your college, you can do anything to go on for a date with her. But as soon as she becomes your girlfriend and then you start talking to her daily for hours every day, it will exponentially decrease that initial attraction you had for her. Similarly, keep that boundary with your customers so that they can be repeat buyers.</p><p><strong>Clips4sale providing free marketing and promotion for your clip store studio</strong></p><p>The best part about joining a clipstore like clips4sale is the platform you get. The audience is right there you just need to make yourself known to that audience. The toughest part of getting the audience is handled by c4s itself.</p><p>When you are a newbie/rookie/newcomer, clips4sale provide you with that initial boost of free promotion to set you up for the audience in your category. The best case scenario for you is to maximize that free promotion and marketing.</p><p>On the homepage of Clips4sale, there is a section known as &#8220;New Studios&#8221;, here you will be given the free exposure once you are verified as a studio by the c4s staff team. This exposure won&#8217;t stay for long as many other new studios are being added every day.</p><p>There is a list of 50, and on average it will give you 7-8 days on the front page.</p><p>Apart from the homepage, you are also listed on the category main page.</p><p>So here is the list of places you will be listed:</p><ol><li>Homepage of clips4sale as a New Studio section &#8211; On average 7-8 days</li><li>Category main page &#8211; Days depend on the number of studios, if there are less than 50 studios you will be listed here for many months</li><li>Apart from your main category &#8220;new studio&#8221; place you will also be shown in recently updated studio in your main category page</li><li>You will also be shown in the recently updated categories you chose apart from your main category</li></ol><p>Now you must be wondering that initially I just told you that getting sales on the first day or even in the first week is so tough, then how come this free promotion is beneficial for me?</p><p>It gives you exposure, gets you noticed and the sales will come a little later. People will come back after looking at you and make a sale later. So when they come for the first time you need to captivate them, make an amazing 10/10 first impression, forcing them to come back and buy your clips. So how to make that killer first impression you ask? Read on&#8230;</p><p>Adding a Banner advertisement</p><p>Creating a banner is easy, you just have to go to the Tutorials page and the instructions are pretty self-explanatory.</p><p>Open the &#8220;Banner Generator&#8221;</p><p>Click on the Tutorial tab</p><p>Create a good looking banner of size 468px x 72px and name it as banner.jpg (this is standard and this is what you have to name it)</p><p>Upload the newly created banner image to your Images Folder</p><p>Now your banner is created and will be shown in the on of the three 468px x 72px banners on the clips4sale homepage. One banner is in an amazing location in the middle of the list, and other two are in the footer.</p><p><strong>Apart from the homepage of Clips4sale, can my banner be displayed in category homepage as well?</strong></p><p>Yes, it will be shown but only if you have uploaded a clip in that category at least once.</p><p>Note: Do not expect a crazy traffic after you start this banner rotation option of clips4sale, it is a very popular trick and every studio is already doing it.</p><p><strong>Adding a twitter account for your clips4sale </strong>clipstore<strong> studio</strong></p><p>Social media is the new ways of connecting and you can easily tap this huge potential of social media. Your studio can be associated with a  twitter handle so that the recent tweets will be shown there. It also gives you authenticity and add a flavor to your studio. Just like I mentioned earlier, I do not like the keep any stone unturned when I talk about promotion of any clips4sale clipstore studio.</p><p>The best scenario is to keep the manual tweeting but you can even add an auto tweet feature, so whenever you add any clip it will automatically be posted on your timeline. This can be activated through &#8220;Store Add-On&#8221;.</p><p>Apart from tweeting about it on your timeline, you can also tweet it on &#8220;c4supdates&#8221;</p><p><strong>Promoting through uploading different versions of your clips for different categories</strong></p><p>We discussed this in our Clips4sale guide, that the main .mp4 hd file should be uploaded in the main category and other lower quality versions must be uploaded in other related category.</p><p>Note: You can only upload a clip in other related category only if it has at least one-third of the category you are listing in.</p><p>Tip: do not post the main video in main category and other videos in the related category at once. Clips4sale has this policy that on the recently updated Studio list on the clips4sale homepage cannot have the studio name more than once. So you will be listed only once although you uploaded in two different categories. So keep a time lag between them so that you can maximize the exposure</p><p>Note: It usually take approximately 20 minutes for a studio to enter as the recently updated in the list and then be removed after new studios are being updated and added to the list.</p><p>The best case scenario is to schedule your clips to be activated, you can easily do that. In the end, the goal should be maximum front page exposure.</p><p><strong>The best time to update your clips4sale clipstore studio</strong></p><p>Since we are going in detail lets dig deep. The majority of the clips4sale audience is coming from Tier-1 countries like the US, United Kingdom, Germany etc.</p><p>Since majority of the people get free at night and that is pleasure time, so they will be most active in between 9:00pm to 2: 00am.This means when you post an update more people will be coming back to your studio and the chances of a sale are higher.</p><p>Pro tip: Its a basic human nature to think of numbers such as 2:00pm, 4:00 pm when comes to scheduling. No one thinks of 3:03 pm etc. Here this can be your edge. Every good studio knows that they will be scheduling their clips according to the time zone when they can get maximum traffic. But they will be scheduling for time like 1:00am, 11:00pm, so instead of that, you can schedule for 11:03pm, so the number of clips scheduled at 11:00pm will be updated and you clip will sit on top of them</p><p><strong>Updating your studio is key to making money</strong></p><p>If you do not update your studio with new clips you will soon be forgotten. The clips4sale clipstore game is such that you need to constantly add new clips and keep updating your studio.</p><p>I know creating new clips is time-consuming and you need to hard work, but then again making money is not that easy.</p><p>Also, try to keep a mix of length of the clips you produce. Longer clips will be sold for more money, as the clip price is based on the length of the clip. So don&#8217;t just stick to either smaller or longer clips, keep the variation going</p><p>Making longer clips do not mean, you remove the quality. Never compromise with quality, I am reiterating it again and again but never ever compromise with the quality of the clip</p><p>If you are busy with your day job or creating updates is not humanly possible for you, then do not compromise on other aspects of life just for uploading your clips. But yes you need to update at least once per day to be able to reach a mark of close to $1,000 per month. The best feature is scheduling, if you think that for the next week you will be very busy then you can work hard on one particular day in then schedule the updates so that the clip sales do not stop and you keep making money.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> Cutting the clips is not recommended but you can cut the clips if the clips obtained after cutting can be used in different categories without compromising the quality.</p><p>If you understand it practically you can easily relate to it. If you are updating let&#8217;s say 4-6 times a day, that means you are putting in the hard work for producing the clips, so eventually you climb up the top50 studio list.</p><p><strong>What are the secret tactics used by the top studios to remain at the Top50 top studio list:</strong></p><ol><li>Amazing high-quality content. Their videos are top notch and they know exactly what their customers want</li><li>Smart and amazing promotional techniques. Videos promotion, social media, Buying ads, email list building etc.</li><li>Utilizing the trying categories. If you understand the current trend it is &#8220;Taboo”, maybe next year it will be something else. You just need to take the biggest slice of what&#8217;s working and capitalize on that</li><li>A strong fan base community and making it even stronger</li><li>Producing high-quality clips regularly. Regularity is the key.</li><li>There might be other tactics that they use, honestly, I don&#8217;t know. But the above-stated points are the core of a successful clipstore studio.</li></ol><p>Till now all I have told you is about how you can utilize the internal free promotion/exposure that clips4sale provide you. The best part is that the audience is targeted and relevant to what you are selling. But then again the competition is fierce.</p><p><strong>Let&#8217;s now talk about promotion/marketing away from clips4sale.</strong></p><p>There are many ways to get traffic back to your studio. You might be tempted by the obvious choices like,</p><ol><li>Facebook Page</li><li>Twitter Followers</li><li>Finding targeted category based forums and communities</li><li>Friends and fans on tube websites accounts</li><li>Personal website</li><li>Xvideo Free Traffic Generation guide</li></ol><p>Above stated are the popular ways of promotion. But you will be surprised the amount of effort that you spent in these ways and the results you get are not what you would be expecting. The number of sales will be low for such external promotion, but in the end, it is required as well</p><p>Note: Please keep in mind about protecting your identity and maintain your privacy. Sometimes unknowingly you might share your location, which can have adverse impact on your privacy</p><p>So where shall a clips4sale clipstore studio make accounts on the internet for promotion:</p><ol><li>Facebook and YouTube: But the chances of you getting banned is high, so need to pay close attention to not showing any nudity or even anything close to nudity</li><li>Tumblr: Its a great way of driving relevant targeted audience to your studio (I wrote a whole guide on this topic: <a href="http://makemoneyadultcontent.com/drive-tumblr-traffic-adult-free/">Tumblr Guide – Drive enormous adult traffic</a></li><li>Google+ Profile: Google gives a huge push to google+ posts in terms of search preference. So you can utilize that</li><li>Fatlike: You can promote yourself here</li><li>Clips4sale Producer Group</li><li>Reddit : A must have account. Its an amazing community. Also, you will have to make an account on Imgur to be able to post your pics on Reddit, as Reddit only allows Imgur pics</li><li>Google your niche/category on Google and find the best (most active and biggest) forums in your niche/category. Make an account on them and start making a following. <strong>Do not </strong>spam or try any ill-practice for self-promotion, the only way to build a following is through adding value and being genuine</li></ol><p>One thing you need to keep in mind is that if you want to not expose yourself, or you are too particular about your category and do not wish to be revealed, then you should avoid Facebook.</p><p>Whenever you upload a video there are several ways of promotion</p><ol><li>Tweet about it</li><li>Post the Gif of that video on your Tumblr account</li><li>You can use the software SnagIt for clicking pictures from your videos. Upload this pic to Igor, fet life and use the Imgur uploaded pic for posting in Reddit (find the subreddit of your category). Do not forget to watermark the image</li></ol><p>If you have any other amazing working way for self-promotion, please share it in the comments section below or email it to me suing <a href="../contact-us/index.html">Contact US</a>.

So What are Clipsites Clips4sale. It's an amazing business model and an extremely profiting one as well. They take a percentage share of your income for offering you the platform (website, promotion, video hosting, payment processing etc).\r\nClip sizes can be at an individual level or a company level. Either an individual or a company can open his\/her\/its store and start selling clips. The clip sites offers you a readymade platform to host your clips and many other advantages in exchange of a commission ranging from (25%-70%)\r\n\r\nThere are many key players online in\u00a0Clipsites Clips4sale category :\r\n\r\n \tClips4sale\r\n \tiwantclips\r\n \tyezzclips\r\n \tKinkbomb\r\n \tmy-dirtyhobby\r\n\r\nAmong the popular ones, clips4sale leads the pack. It is the biggest clipstore online and highly profitable.\r\n\r\nRevenue Sharing or Percentage Profit that clips4sale takes off your income is 40%. Yes, i know you must be wondering that a huge number, but in all honesty, the facilities they provides are tremendous. I know we are humans and 40% looks huge but that industry average. Other not so popular clip sites might offer you a better share like 70% of your revenue, but that is because they are not as big as clips4sale. They want to survive in this industry while clips4sale is taking majority of the share. These smaller clipsites sometimes even allow you to sell clips with your watermark of clips4sale on it.\r\n\r\nNote: If you are uploading your clips on multiple clip sites, then keep the title, description, price same, otherwise a customer might buy a clip only to find out that its one of the same clip he bought someplace else.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the Percentage share or your cut on the clips you sell:\r\n\r\nYou percentage share depends on many factors:\r\n\r\n \tClipsite\r\n \tDemographic or audience of that clipsite\r\n \tNiche or categories it caters to\r\n \tFew other factors\r\n\r\nIndustry average is you as a clip producer getting 60% share. Few websites cater to a very specific niche and would give you even lesser. If it is a country specific website then your cut might be even lower\r\n\r\nWhy not I start my own website and keep 100% of revenue:\r\n\r\nYes, you can but creating\u00a0 a website looks very simple, but it is highly complex. You can easily create a website for yourself.

You could easily spend this time creating more clips and be happy with the 60% revenue you get.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem is that it is an adult niche. So major payment processors won't accept you and the alternatives are expensive and not worth the time.\r\n\r\nAdvantages of using a clipsite clipstore for selling clips are:\r\n\r\n \tThey give you a ready-made platform\r\n \tTargeted audience (The most important reason)\r\n \tFree promotion, marketing (Again a very expensive area)\r\n \tHosting your videos, bandwidth, customer support (all this is expensive)\r\n \tPayment processing capability\r\n \tKeeping you away from the hassle of technical stuff and keeping you focused on the most important job - Producing clips and keeping the customer happy\r\n \tEmail List management : A vital tool for promotion\r\n\r\nHow To Become A Top Selling clips4sale Studio\r\nThis is the first question that comes into everyone's\u00a0mind when they start aa s aclips4sale clip stores studio owner.

This article on ClipLength Guide clips4sale will cover everything about the length of the clips you upload. For a beginner or a newbie, it might be confusing as clips4sale has a little complex system. Although it sounds very trivial that its just clip length what could be wrong with it, but one must know the clips4sale guidelines on uploading the clips.\r\n\r\nIf you have a slow internet connection and then you upload your clip only to find out that the video has been rejected by clips4sale for some reason, it's frustrating.\r\n\r\nCategory 1 : 2 minutes to 19 minutes clips\r\n\r\nOn clips4sale, a clip changes its minute at 00:45 mark. i.e. 15:48 is 16 minutes and 15:44 is 15 minutes\r\n\r\nAlso, the size of the clips in this category must be less than 1GB\r\n\r\nCategory 2: 20 minutes to 29 minutes\r\n\r\nHere the clip size must be less than 1.2 GB. Although you will find many clips on the clipstores\u00a0 of others that are in between this range of clip length but still the size is significantly large. So there are exceptions, but why to try something like this and follow the rules.\r\n\r\nCategory 3 - 30 minutes and more\r\n\r\nThe file size of such clips need to be less than 2 GB, but then again you can find exceptions to this rule as well.\r\n\r\nWhile you are about to hit the export button on your software you will get an estimate of the size o the clip, so keep it within the clips4sale guidelines.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nHow to store all the files? (Raw videos, statistics, customer\u00a0data etc.\r\nBuying a two terabyte hard disk is a must if you own a clips4sale clip stores\u00a0studios. You need to keep your data safe, so making two copies also helps to protect the data in case one hard disk crashes or gets corrupted.\r\n\r\nNaming the files is also important. You should follow one naming convention so that it is easy for you to find. Proper folder structure with dates and tags to remind you about the clips.\r\n\r\nSometimes you need to visit the old content, as you might be thinking of making a compilation video. Or more like an upgraded version of previous clips, or maybe like a series of part-1, part2 etc.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\u00a0Offline advertisements, and how to master it, should a clips4sale clip stores studio focus on external\/offline advertisements\r\nAlthough this is a very debatable topic, but the balance goes on to social media for some and for some it's another method.\r\n\r\nAlthough you can go for paid advertisements, but you have to remember that these cips4sale clipstore clips are not that expensive. And also clips4sale take a 40% cut in that, so the money you spent for each clip sale and the income you make is very hard to balance and see a significant positive difference\r\n\r\nBut trend has shown that majority of clips4sale studios have seen maximum sales through social media channel\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nHow to handle piracy in clips4sale clipstore\u00a0studio clips?\r\nIt is a very personal choice for you. First, you will have to understand\u00a0one very important fact that\r\n\r\nThe majority of the free tube websites who upload your content, their audience are free loaders. Almost all of them love free content and they will never pay for your clips.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to consider is that some studios take this as free publicity. You get exposure on various other websites as your clips are being uploaded. So, in the end, its very personal choice of you to handle it or not.\r\n\r\nHandling piracy is very easy, all you have to do is find the DMCA page on the tube website. Every tube website has a DMCA page. That page has all the steps that you need to take in order to get your clip removed from their website. Generally, these are the steps that you need to follow:\r\n\r\n \tan electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright or other intellectual property interest;\r\n \tdescription of the copyrighted work or another intellectual property that you claim has been infringed\r\n \ta description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the SITE, must include the specific URL's associated with each file\r\n \tyour address, telephone number, and email address;\r\n \ta statement by you that you have a good-faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and,\r\n \ta statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your Notice is accurate and that you are the copyright or intellectual property owner or authorized to act on the copyright or intellectual property owner\u2019s behalf.\r\n\r\nFinding the websites which are pirating your content is also very easy. Just google your studio's name, and sort the result by \"last month\", \"last week\" or \"last year\" and send the notice to all of them.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nWhat is the list of best Hardware, software, to use for opening clips4sale clip store studio?\r\nI will be writing a detailed article on this topic very soon. Keep checking back, or bookmark this post\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nHaving breast\/boob implants help in getting more sales on clips4sale\u00a0clipstore studio?\r\nThe answer is very easy. Definitely yes. I am not saying that it works for everyone. It is just that you have to find your differentiating factor. Being a clips4sale clipstore model\/studio owner, you need to find your unique selling point in the crowd. The competition is immense and for gaining a loyal and paying fan base you need to be unique.\r\n\r\nEveryone has some unique trait that they can capitalize upon. You just have to find that. for egg:\r\n\r\n \tYou might have very large feet\r\n \tNaturally redhead\r\n \tYou voice is remarkable\r\n \tAny other body feature which no one else has\r\n \tRacial and ethnic background\r\n \tYou dressing style\r\n\r\nThese are just a few, you can position yourself in many other ways. You have to find it and make money off it by highlighting that feature as much as possible\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nDoes collaboration with other clips4sale clipstore models\/studio help in clipsales?\r\nThis is a very lucrative area. It can be tremendously helpful for you if done right. Make sure who you are working with is professional and knows what she is doing. You can pay them or do a content trade arrangement.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nDoes working in Mainstream Porn movies help in increasing the clips4sale\u00a0clipstore clipsales?\r\nI have talked to much successful clips4sale clipstore models\/studio owners, who did not see any significant increase in clipsales even after signing a deal with some major players in the porn industry.\r\n\r\nDefinitely, it provides you exposure and free marketing, but in terms of more clipsales, it does not translate to that.\r\n\r\nI will not lead to doubling your clip4sale clip store clip sales.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nWhat are the best offline Promotion tactics to use?\r\nSocial media has worked great for many clipstore studios so I will talk about that. Engaging\u00a0everyday\u00a0on Facebook, twitter, Instagram, Tumblr are a must. You should also be active on Fetish Forums in your category\/niche.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI hope this article\u00a0Clipstore Clips4sale Tips ,Tricks have helped you gain some new knowledge, keep reading for more.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nUpdating your clips4sale clipstore studio. How important is that\r\nI have stressed this multiple times, but the sure shot way of success inclips4sale is to update your studio multiple times a day. I hope you have gone through all the articles on this website in our clips4sale\/clipstore category. I request you to go through each one of them. Every article has a ton of free knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe majority of your traffic will come from clips4sale website itself. Updating your store makes you visible in the front page for some time, that will directly send you visitors and hence making more sales.\r\n\r\nThere are many techniques on how you can update you store more often without producing actual clips. I have shared that on other articles. So please check out all articles in this category to be able to make more money and become more successful\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nShowing your face in clips4sale clipstore clips? how important is that\r\nNot showing your face will directly be a big disadvantage for you. No customer wants to see just the nude parts without any face. You cannot satisfy them only 50%, and expect to make them happy. The face is everything.\r\n\r\nYes, I understand that showing your faces in clips where you are getting nude might be a little scary thinking about your privacy. But trust me this is a sure shot way of a disaster of your clips4sale clipstore studio\/career. There are many other ways you can protect your identity:\r\n\r\n \tDoing makeup\r\n \tWearing props like wigs\r\n \tAdding glasses on our face\r\n \tWearing unconventional costumes\r\n\r\nAbove two points in itself can alter your appearance and make you look like a totally different person.\r\n\r\nMake sure to not brag about your profession\/sales\/money you made to your friends or to your family. That is the only thing that can create a havoc in your life\r\n\r\nGetting naked or nude in a clip is also not 100% essential. There are many categories where you can be successful without getting naked. Fro e.g.: Mina Thorne in dominatrix\r\n\r\nYou must understand one thing, that nudity always helps. In the end, people\/your customers are buying the clips to jerk off. Nudity alleviates that mood and helps them satisfy their urges. If you will see the statistics between nude and nonuse clips, almost always you will see much more sales in clips in which you were naked.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nTalking on camera in clips4sale clipstore clips\r\nThis is one of the common problems with newbies\/rookies\/newcomers on clips4sale. They don't know how and what to talk about on the camera.\r\n\r\nHonestly, the only solution to this is to do more clips. It comes with practice. Some tips from my end would be:\r\n\r\n \tStart describing what you are doing. Tell them what you see. Tell them how you are feeling\r\n \tSlow it down. Don't be in a hurry to complete the clip. Everyone loves slow steady actions\r\n \tDescribe everything while performing slowly\r\n \tWatch videos of other clip store\u00a0owners in your category to find exactly how they are talking to the camera.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nDominatrix\/Ridicule category clips4sale\r\nNot everyone is well suited for every category. Someone is good in one category but might not be as good in some other category. I know that\u00a0Dominatrix\/Ridicule has become a very popular niche fetish and everyone has started making clips in that. If you are not comfortable making such clips, then don't feel disappointed. You can make equal amount of money in some other category in which you are comfortable and love to perform\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nDo multiple stores help in clip sales on clips4sale clipstore?\r\nYes, definitely, but you also have to consider the workload that just got doubled. There are two ways to look at this.\r\n\r\n \tYou can make a separate store, put in the hard work and effort to set it up and do everything to get it as successful as the first one. The advantages with the second store will be:\r\n\r\n \tYou already know what works, so the time you spent on the first store for learning what works and what doesn't is easily cut off\r\n \tyou already have a fan following, so the initial launch of your new store will have great traffic\r\n\r\n\r\n \tThe other option is to start producing double the clips in the first store. Growing an already established company is easier than building a new company and then growing it.\r\n\r\nFro the first option, you might be creating a new store because the category is totally unrelated and your current fan base might not be ale to relate to it. so you can decide to create a new store.\r\n\r\nCreating multiple stores also do not mean you start 7-10 stores thinking that you will be handle everything. Trust me this is a recipe for disaster. This way you will be driving your attention in 7-10 parts and nothing will work.\r\n\r\nFocus on 2-3 stores at maximum, and try to increase the traffic of each one of them. In the end it's all about the number of updates you can put without compromising the quality of the clips\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nCreating similar videos for clips4sale clipstore studio\r\nIf you are in a category where changing the environment or the very act itself is very difficult. Let's say anything related to oral, tongue. Then adding the variety or something new in the new clips you upload will be difficult. But that is something that might be bothering you.\r\n\r\nFor someone who has a fetish for that, he will be happy with the new clips even with very few changes. He loves that fetish for a reason, and even small changes like moaning, wig, and lipstick color, smile, etc. can have the same impact on him\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nWhat is the best filming time\/day for a clips4sale clipstore studio\/model?\r\nIt depends totally on you. If you are giving your full time to clips4sale, then try to produce as many clips as possible but while being smart. Creating new content and updating your store regularly is the sure shot way for success. You must update your store with a new clip at least once a day. If you have multiple studios, then each studio should be updated with a new clip at least once a day.\r\n\r\nAlso, try to make longer clips as they will give you maximum revenue. (clip length directly proportional to the clip price)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nUploading recorded cam shows on clips4sale clip store\r\nI do not recommend this method. Many studio owner does this to make money with minimum effort. The majority of your customer\u2019s dislike recorded cam shows being uploaded. Recorded cam shows are just like telling your consumers that you want to make some quick bucks with minimum effort so you uploaded those instead. Always focus on\r\n\r\nAlways focus on hard work and quality. Honestly, I have seen that making money on lcips4sale as a clipstore owner is much more than that of as a camming model\/webcam model.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nBest Video Editing Software for Clips4sale Clip store studio video production\r\nI personally love Adobe Premiere Pro. But then again its a very expensive software, and takes some time to learn.\r\n\r\nOne great solution if you are not able to afford such expensive product is to join Adobe Creative Cloud. This is more like a renting service, where you will get every Adobe software for just a few dollars per month. So in the beginning phase of your journey when you are not making some serious cash, then you can join this and pay monthly fees while enjoying the benefits of such amazing products\r\n\r\nYou also don't need to be connected to the internet for it to work, you can easily use it offline.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nDoes YouTube help in promotion of clips4sale clipstore studio\r\nHonestly, sooner or later you will be shut down. Being an adult model, you will be looked at with shady eyes and this could result in your channel getting shut.\r\n\r\nAlso, if your videos are regularly getting flagged that also leads to getting your YouTube account banned.\r\n\r\nSo you can try, but it did not work in my case\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nTime it takes for making clips4sale a main source of income\r\nThis question has no absolute answer. The dollar figure differs for everyone. Some factors that impact this are:\r\n\r\n \tGrowing the fan base: Producing quality clips regularly, interviews, appearances, more and more promotion\r\n \tProducing good quality clips, and updating the store every day\r\n \tFollowing all the tips and advice shared with you on this website\r\n \tBeing Smart: This is something that cannot be taught. Following the trends, what\u2019s working, what\u2019s selling and then creating clips in that niche.\r\n \tOne point that you can't do much about - Luck\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nWhat is the dollar figure that can help me get in Top 50 studios?\r\nGenerally earning close to $250 per day will get you in the Top-50 studios. \u00a0But that needs to be consistent, not just a one-day sales figure\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nOpening Multiple Stores and Linking them together on clips4sale\r\nThe answer is YES, you can open multiple stores and link them as well. If you have the same payment information for all the stores you own, then you will receive one payment instead of multiple payments for each studio.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nHow can you Post a link in your store that leads to all your clips in a certain category?\r\nHere is a screenshot of how you can achieve this:\r\n\r\n \tClick on Clip store\r\n \tList clips\r\n \t\"Direct links to store categories\"\r\n \tAnd there you can add the links\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nConverting Videos on MAC, which software:\r\nYou can use FLV Crunch to convert on the MAC.\r\n\r\nHere is the link:\u00a0http:\/\/download.cnet.com\/Flv-Crunch\/3000-2194_4-10909295.html\r\n\r\nYou can convert from many different formats to many different formats\r\nHow does the email system on Clips4sale Works?\r\nEvery customer has an option to sign ups for the email list. This is not an automatic thing that a person is automatically subscribed if he\/she purchases a clip.\r\n\r\nYou can then send them an email about the clip that you want to sell.\r\n\r\nThis is a resource that many studios utilize but look at its potential. Whenever you upload a new clip and send them a notification about it, you can get instant sales. Also, the people on the list is targeted, i.e. the people are already interested in that category\r\nHow to make good sales, get noticed, increase views of my store on clips4sale?\r\nI will give a list of points that you must follow:\r\n\r\n \tUpload as much as you can. Updating your store as often as possible is the best way of\u00a0making good sales, get noticed, increase views of the store on clips4sale. Updating gives you the benefit of getting featured on recently updated store and that helps in driving traffic back to your store.\r\n\r\n \tYou will notice that once you stop updating and uploading new videos, your daily sales will drop significantly\r\n\r\n\r\n \tUpload to different categories. When you are starting as a beginner\/rookie\/newbie then you need to find that best category for you. For this you can experiment and see where is your sweet spot. So trying and testing is the only savior you have\r\n \tUploading the same clips in different formats: You can upload the same clips (but of different format) to different categories. You can also schedule them to be updated at different times.\r\n\r\n \tClips4sale Tip: When you upload the same clip in different file format, then go to your first clip listing, click on \"New clip\" at the bottom of the page and a new clip form will open up. This will already have all the field filled up, so you do not have to input everything again\r\n\r\n\r\n \tWork with preview image and GIF animation.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nDelete and Reload trick Clips4sale\r\nYes, there is a way to delete your old clips and then reupload then to get yourself featured in \"Recently Updated\" category page, the second time for the same clip. But there is a rookie mistake that you can do. You might just delete the clips from \"List Clips\" section and think the clip is deleted. Now when you upload the new clip it is not shown in the\u00a0\"Recently Updated\" category, because the file was not deleted from Clips4sale servers.\r\n\r\nTo be able to delete your video clip\/file from c4s servers as well you need to follow these screenshots:\r\n\r\n \tGo to New Uploader - Add\/Delete files\r\n \tClick on the recycle bin image against each clip\r\n\r\nNow to get featured in the \"recently updated\" category page second time around for the same clip, just upload the clip with a different name\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nHow to Upload the W9 documents, after printing and signing?\r\nYou can either scan the documents and then upload or if you don't have a scanner, just click a clean photo with your smartphone and upload it\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nClips4sale staff temporary access to uploaded videos?\r\nYes, you can get a temporary access to all the c4s clips you ever uploaded.

It's more like an archive, so browsing through this page can save a lot of time of you\r\n\r\nThis can also be a small indicator of how competitive that particular category is without visiting that category page\r\nHow to handle personal clip request on Clips4sale\r\nThere are multiple ways you can handle this:\r\n\r\n \tCharge the full price before producing the video, and then use any file sharing platform (like Dropbox) for sharing the link\r\n \tYou can also upload the clip to your clips4sale, from where they can purchase\r\n \tOther way is to get a fees\/amount initially for agreement, and then upload the clip on clips4sale store, where they can buy the clip.\r\n\r\nI hope\u00a0Clipstore Clips4sale Tips, Tricks - your questions answered was helpful to you. If you have any other question or query, please ask it in comments section below.\r\nClipstore Marketing and Promotion - Complete most effective guide\r\nToday I will be giving you another long but super effective article on how\u00a0to do\u00a0Clipstore Marketing Promotion - Complete most effective guide.\u00a0Why you joined clips4sale is very obvious - to make some decent passive income and hoping to make clips4sale the major source of revenue in the future\r\n\r\nClipstore Marketing Promotion - Clips4sale Free Traffic Generate. We will cover all the tips, tricks, techniques, methods that work for free traffic generation which leads to more sale and more exposure.\r\n\r\nYou already know that for every sale you make on clips4sale, the company c4s.com take 40% and you are left with 60%. Whenever someone starts a business, the most prominent thing on his mind if to find the exact dollar amount he\/she can make in this business, in various stages:\r\n\r\n \tHow much money can I make on clips4sale in my first month\r\n \tHow much money can I make on clips4sale\u00a0per month after 6 months\r\n \tHow much money can I make on clips4sale\u00a0per month after one year\r\n\r\nUsually one year is the future benchmark one takes to base his decision whether to start in this business or not.\r\n\r\nThe Answer to above questions is not absolute, it depends on many factors such as:\r\n\r\n \tHow often you update your clips4sale studio\r\n \tHow much hard work are you willing to put in\r\n \tAre you smart enough to find your differentiating factor to be able to stand out in the crowd and beat your competition\r\n \tHow fast and How soon can you make solid connection with your audience\r\n \tThe category you are in\r\n \tAnd most importantly, whether the clips you produce are of good quality or not\r\n\r\nNow for an amateur\/rookie\/beginner, considering he\/she does not have any following, prior expeice, or any connection to big players, he\/she can expect to earn between $250-900 per month. This income will increase month on month just like for any other business but will come to a standstill or a downward curve because people are now used to your videos. They have already seen many videos of you and need something new in their life, a new face, (I know it sucks but that\u2019s the harsh reality). But worry not, its a more advanced concept, and I will write an article about it soon.\r\n\r\nNote:\u00a0The range\u00a0$250-900 per month is not an absolute number, I cannot comment on others making much more than that or even lower than that. That is an average number that I have seen after some experience in this industry\r\n\r\nIf you will look the 6 month or 12 months\u2019 earnings curve, you will see an upward movement in the first few months and then a stagnant or maybe even a decline. Then it should\/might balance in between.\r\n\r\nThere was a common belief that if you are among the top clips4sale studio, then you could make upwards of $30,000 per month. But honestly, this is not true. One of the Famous Clips4sale studios disclosed his income and the figures were like this:\r\n\r\nFor a rank #8 on top 50 clips4sale studio, he was making close to $2500 per week.\r\n\r\nFor a rank #2 on top 50 clips4sale studios, he was making close to $3,000 per week. Which translates into 3,000x4 = $12,000 per month, which is nowhere close to $30,000 per month.\r\n\r\nOne good thing is that as you start producing more clips and experience, you will get to where exactly you can save some time. Let\u2019s say if you are spending 50hrs\/week on your clips4sale studio making XXXX dollars per week. \u00a0After few months you will easily be making same or more money in just 20-30hrs\/week, this is because now you know exactly how you can save up time and become more efficient. This extra saved time can be used to make more money by building websites, other clips4sale studios or camming studio.\r\n\r\nNote: If you think these numbers are not satisfactory and if you are feeling discourages then please don't do that. If you are hardworking and smart you can easily make money and there is huge potential for that. You can easily make a comfortable living out of clips4sale\r\n\r\nSome more metrics for you:\r\n\r\n \tThe majority of your clips sale will be in the form of one (1) clip sales. Close to 70% of your total sales\r\n \tAround 25% of your total sales will be a 2-3 clip order\r\n \t5% of your total sales will be 4 clip orders or more.\r\n \tOn average 100 visit to your store will give you 1 one sale, and on average one sale is close to $10\r\n\r\nSo yes, if you can get targeted visitors to your studio then your sales will increase. Please not these are not absolute numbers, the data is experienced by me and other studios, as also compared with other resources on the internet.\r\n\r\nTip: Do not let one day, one week, or one month affect your mindset. Humans are designed to see instant results, but you will have to look at the bigger picture and long-term average of your studio clipstore.\r\n\r\nNow let's talk about an important point. The First month of launching your clip store\/Studio:\r\n\r\nYou might be all charged up, you have done all the hardwork, uploaded the videos, and did everything that you could learn from this website and other resources on the internet. You might be feeling the rush in your veins of looking at $$$ amount in your admin panel. But at the end of the day, you see zero sales.\r\n\r\nYes, you will see some hits (visitor traffic) in your admin but you might not see any sale. You might not even see a sale in one week (worst case scenario). But this is the pain period. Not getting disheartened and working without losing hope is the trait of a true champion. Weak hearted people quit because they wanted to get rich quick, they wanted to see instant results, but nothing in this world comes so easy.\r\n\r\nMany studios have wasted their time, uploading the clips4sale mandatory 10 clips and few updates, but when they did not see any sales, they quit.\r\n\r\nOne Pro tip I can give you is to: Always focus on adding value to someone, money will automatically come. Don't just run after the money, you will never be able to catch it.\r\n\r\nHonestly, initially, you should make realistic goals, enough to cover your daily basic requirements. Don't expect to become one among the top 5 studios within a week.\r\n\r\nThis is one other reason why o always recommends making videos in a category that you love yourself. Because otherwise you will feel the blow much harder because you already don't have any special liking towards the category. You might play the blame game and quit.\r\n\r\nTip: Don't become an information junkie. Its a problem majority of people have. Don't just absorb everything on the internet thinking that I will take actions later. Read only which is relevant to the moment, absorb it, understand it and take action first. You can never be prepared enough to start, in the end, the people who succeed have the courage to take that first step. Not knowing everything is good.\r\n\r\nSetting realistic goals also help you not loose motivation. If you were targeting $10,000 but you are not getting enough sales even for $1,000 per month then trust me, your mental state will not be healthy and it will directly and adversely impact you.\r\n\r\nHope you are enjoying this article on\u00a0Clipstore Marketing Promotion, please read on for more information\r\n\r\nSome Tips you must follow as a Clips4sale Studio Owner:\r\n\r\nNever give a guarantee or 100% promise to your customers:\r\n\r\nYou will find customers who will request you to make a certain kind of clip. You might be tempted and agree by giving him a solid confirmation. But that\u2019s where you went wrong. Never give 100% guarantee that you will do exactly as your customer asked you for. Always use the word, you will try to make such clip. That way you would not have the obligation. If you make it, everyone is happy. But if you do not make it you just lost a customer for rife.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the difference between a customer and a Fan\r\n\r\nThe sooner you realize the difference the sooner it will be beneficial for you. You should treat every visitor who comes to your websites, or any person who buys you clips as\u00a0CUSTOMERS.\u00a0The reason I say this is because in the end you are selling a product, for which your customer pays and satisfy his needs. You are fulfilling a requirement that your customers have.\r\n\r\nFans are different, they like or love you for who you are. They will buy the clips irrespective of whether they love the clip or not.\r\n\r\nYou should always treat everyone as the customer. Treat your Clips4sale\u00a0clipstore\u00a0studio as a business where you are selling a product and people are coming there to buy that product.\r\n\r\nRelationship with your customers\r\n\r\nYes, when you are in a\u00a0clipstore\u00a0studio business type environment you try your best to be as authentic as possible. You show your genuine self so that you a build solid relationships and win the trust of your customers. You try everything to show a good face, produce good quality clips, keep your customer needs in mind, do not indulge in any mal-practice of making money. You go one step ahead and treat every customer as more than a customer and try to create strong bonds by being more personal.\r\n\r\nHere comes the problem, being genuine in your approach is a sure shot way of success, but being personal is the worst way you can do that. For your customers, you are a fantasy, a figure that satisfies their sexual urges. You give them mental peace; whatever way it be.\r\n\r\nWhen you try to be personal, you reveal too much unnecessary information and you end up destroying that image. Just like if you are a guy, you fantasize about the perfect most gorgeous girl in your college, you can do anything to go on for a date with her. But as soon as she becomes your girlfriend and then you start talking to her daily for hours every day, it will exponentially decrease that initial attraction you had for her. Similarly, keep that boundary with your customers so that they can be repeat buyers.\r\n\r\nClips4sale providing free marketing and promotion for your clip store studio\r\n\r\nThe best part about joining a clipstore like clips4sale is the platform you get. The audience is right there you just need to make yourself known to that audience. The toughest part of getting the audience is handled by c4s itself.\r\n\r\nWhen you are a newbie\/rookie\/newcomer, clips4sale provide you with that initial boost of free promotion to set you up for the audience in your category. The best case scenario for you is to maximize that free promotion and marketing.\r\n\r\nOn the homepage of Clips4sale, there is a section known as \"New Studios\", here you will be given the free exposure once you are verified as a studio by the c4s staff team. This exposure won't stay\u00a0for long as many other new studios are being added every day.\r\n\r\nThere is a list of 50, and on average it will give you 7-8 days on the front page.\r\n\r\nApart from the homepage, you are also listed on the category main page.\r\n\r\nSo here is the list of places you will be listed:\r\n\r\n \tHomepage of clips4sale as a New Studio section - On average 7-8 days\r\n \tCategory main page - Days depend on the number of studios, if there are less than 50 studios you will be listed here for many months\r\n \tApart from your main category \"new studio\" place you will also be shown in recently updated studio in your main category page\r\n \tYou will also be shown in the recently updated categories you chose apart from your main category\r\n\r\nNow you must be wondering that initially I just told you that getting sales on the first day or even in the first week is so tough, then how come this free promotion is beneficial for me?\r\n\r\nIt gives you exposure, gets you noticed and the sales will come a little later. People will come back after looking at you and make a sale later. So when they come for the first time you need to captivate them, make an amazing 10\/10 first impression, forcing them to come back and buy your clips. So how to make that killer first impression you ask? Read on...\r\n\r\nAdding a Banner advertisement\r\n\r\nCreating a banner is easy, you just have to go to the Tutorials page and the instructions are pretty self-explanatory.\r\n\r\nOpen the \"Banner Generator\"\r\n\r\nClick on the Tutorial tab\r\n\r\nCreate a good looking banner of size 468px x 72px and name it as banner.jpg (this is standard and this is what you have to name it)\r\n\r\nUpload the newly created banner image to your Images Folder\r\n\r\nNow your banner is created and will be shown in the\u00a0on of the three 468px x 72px banners on the clips4sale homepage. One banner is in an amazing location in the middle of the list, and other two are in the footer.\r\n\r\nApart from the homepage of Clips4sale, can my banner be displayed in category homepage as well?\r\n\r\nYes, it will be shown but only if you have uploaded a clip in that category at least once.\r\n\r\nNote: Do not expect a crazy traffic after you start this banner rotation option of clips4sale, it is a very popular trick and every studio is already doing it.\r\n\r\nAdding a twitter account for your clips4sale\u00a0clipstore\u00a0studio\r\n\r\nSocial media is the new ways of connecting and you can easily tap this huge potential of social media. Your studio can be associated with a \u00a0twitter handle so that the recent tweets will be shown there. It also gives you authenticity and add a flavor to your studio. Just like I mentioned earlier, I do not like the keep any stone unturned when I talk about promotion of any clips4sale\u00a0clipstore\u00a0studio.\r\n\r\nThe best scenario is to keep the manual tweeting but you can even add an auto tweet feature, so whenever you add any clip it will automatically be posted on your timeline. This can be activated through \"Store Add-On\".\r\n\r\nApart from tweeting about it on your timeline, you can also tweet it on \"c4supdates\"\r\n\r\nPromoting through uploading different versions of your clips for different categories\r\n\r\nWe discussed this in our Clips4sale guide, that the main .mp4\u00a0hd\u00a0file should be uploaded\u00a0in\u00a0the main category and other lower quality versions must be uploaded\u00a0in\u00a0other related category.\r\n\r\nNote: You can only upload a clip in\u00a0other related category\u00a0only if it has at least one-third of the category you are listing in.\r\n\r\nTip: do not post the main video in main category and other videos in the related category at once. Clips4sale has this policy that on the recently updated Studio list on the clips4sale homepage cannot have the studio name more than once. So you will be listed only once although you uploaded in two different categories. So keep a time lag between them so that you can maximize the exposure\r\n\r\nNote: It usually take approximately 20 minutes for a studio to enter as the recently updated in the list and then be removed after new studios are being updated and added to the list.\r\n\r\nThe best case scenario is to schedule your clips to be activated, you can easily do that. In the end, the goal should be maximum front page exposure.\r\n\r\nThe best time to update your clips4sale\u00a0clipstore\u00a0studio\r\n\r\nSince we are going in detail lets dig deep. The majority of the clips4sale audience is coming from Tier-1 countries like the US, United Kingdom, Germany etc.\r\n\r\nSince majority of the people get free at night and that is pleasure time, so they will be most active in between 9:00pm to 2: 00am.This means when you post an update more people will be coming back to your studio and the chances of a sale are higher.\r\n\r\nPro tip: Its a basic human nature to think of numbers such as 2:00pm, 4:00 pm when comes to scheduling. No one thinks of 3:03 pm etc. Here this can be your edge. Every good studio knows that they will be scheduling their clips according to the time zone when they can get maximum traffic. But they will be scheduling for time like 1:00am, 11:00pm, so instead of that, you can schedule for 11:03pm, so the number of clips scheduled at 11:00pm will be updated and you clip will sit on top of them\r\n\r\nUpdating your studio is key to making money\r\n\r\nIf you do not update your studio with new clips you will soon be forgotten. The clips4sale clipstore game is such that you need to constantly add new clips and keep updating your studio.\r\n\r\nI know creating new clips is time-consuming and you need to hard work, but then again making money is not that easy.\r\n\r\nAlso, try to keep a mix of length of the clips you produce. Longer clips will be sold for more money, as the clip price is based on the length of the clip. So don't just stick to either smaller or longer clips, keep the variation going\r\n\r\nMaking longer clips do not mean, you remove the quality. Never compromise with quality, I am reiterating it again and again but never ever compromise with the quality of the clip\r\n\r\nIf you are busy with your day job or creating updates is not humanly possible for you, then do not compromise on other aspects of life just for uploading your clips. But yes you need to update at least once per day to be able to reach a mark of close to $1,000 per month. The best feature is scheduling, if you think that for the next week you will be very busy then you can work hard on one particular day in then schedule the updates so that the clip sales do not stop and you keep making money.\r\n\r\nTip: Cutting the clips is not recommended but you can cut the clips if the clips obtained after cutting can be used in different categories without compromising the quality.\r\n\r\nIf you understand it practically you can easily relate to it. If you are updating let's say 4-6 times a day, that means you are putting in the hard work for producing the clips, so\u00a0eventually\u00a0you climb up the top50 studio list.\r\n\r\nWhat are the secret tactics used by the top studios to remain at the Top50 top studio list:\r\n\r\n \tAmazing high-quality content. Their videos are top notch and they know exactly what their customers want\r\n \tSmart and amazing promotional techniques. Videos promotion, social media, Buying ads, email list building etc.\r\n \tUtilizing the trying categories. If you understand the current trend it is \"Taboo\u201d, maybe next year it will be something else. You just need to take the biggest slice of what's working and capitalize on that\r\n \tA strong fan base community and making it even stronger\r\n \tProducing high-quality clips regularly. Regularity is the key.\r\n \tThere might be other tactics that they use, honestly, I don't know. But the above-stated points are the core of a successful\u00a0clipstore\u00a0studio.\r\n\r\nTill now all I have told you is about how you can utilize the internal free promotion\/exposure that clips4sale provide you. The best part is that the audience is targeted and relevant to what you are selling. But then again the competition is fierce.\r\n\r\nLet's now talk about promotion\/marketing away from clips4sale.\r\n\r\nThere are many ways to get traffic back to your studio. You might be tempted by the obvious choices like,\r\n\r\n \tFacebook Page\r\n \tTwitter Followers\r\n \tFinding targeted category based forums and communities\r\n \tFriends and fans on tube websites accounts\r\n \tPersonal website\r\n \tXvideo Free Traffic Generation guide\r\n\r\nAbove stated are the popular ways of promotion. But you will be surprised the amount of effort that you spent in these ways and the results you get are not what you would be expecting. The number of sales will be low for such external promotion, but in the end, it is required as well\r\n\r\nNote: Please keep in mind about protecting your identity and maintain your privacy. Sometimes unknowingly you might share your location, which can have adverse impact on your privacy\r\n\r\nSo where shall a clips4sale clipstore studio make accounts on the internet for promotion:\r\n\r\n \tFacebook and YouTube: But the chances of you getting banned is high, so need to pay close attention to not showing any nudity or even anything close to nudity\r\n \tTumblr: Its a great way of driving relevant targeted audience to your studio (I wrote a whole guide on this topic:\u00a0Tumblr Guide \u2013 Drive enormous adult traffic\r\n \tGoogle+ Profile: Google gives a huge push to google+ posts in terms of search preference. So you can utilize that\r\n \tFatlike: You can promote yourself here\r\n \tClips4sale Producer Group\r\n \tReddit : A must have account. Its an amazing community. Also, you will have to make an account on Imgur to be able to post your pics on Reddit, as Reddit only allows Imgur pics\r\n \tGoogle your niche\/category on Google and find the best (most active and biggest) forums in your niche\/category. Make an account on them and start making a following.\u00a0Do not\u00a0spam or try any ill-practice for self-promotion, the only way to build a following is through adding value and being genuine\r\n\r\nOne thing you need to keep in mind is that if you want to not expose yourself, or you are too particular about your category and do not wish to be revealed, then you should avoid Facebook.\r\n\r\nWhenever you upload a video there are several ways of promotion\r\n\r\n \tTweet about it\r\n \tPost the Gif of that video on your Tumblr account\r\n \tYou can use the software SnagIt for clicking pictures from your videos. Upload this pic to Igor, fet life and use the Imgur uploaded pic for posting in Reddit (find the subreddit of your category). Do not forget to watermark the image\r\n\r\nIf you have any other amazing working way for self-promotion, please share it in the comments section below or email it to me suing\u00a0Contact US. It would be really appreciated as other can learn from it as well.\r\n\r\nGoogle Analytics account for tracking and analyzing for your clips4sale\u00a0clipstore\u00a0studio\r\n\r\nGoogle Analytics is the most amazing free tool out there for tracking everything and anything related to your visitors.
