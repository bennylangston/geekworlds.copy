I have shared my earnings proof  in  multiple articles.

If you have tested your campaign thoroughly (CTA, Landing page, Banner, Traffic sources) then you can easily get very cheap traffic converting very well for some amazing offers.</p><h2>What is DOI and SOI affiliate marketing terms</h2><p>Hey hi all, i hope you are making money now. If you are just starting out in adult affiliate marketing then you might hear about the terms DOI and SOI affiliate opt-ins. To help you understand them better i have written this short post for you all</p><p>When you talk about lead generation, or email capturing here is what these terms mean:</p><p><strong>DOI:</strong> Double opt-in. In DOI the user has to verify his email address by clicking on a special link that is sent to his entered email id after he/she signs up on the offer website</p><p><strong>SOI:</strong> Single opt-in. This is where the person just needs to enter his email-id and does not needs to verify it.</p><p>It wont take much to understand that the SOI offer is much lucrative for affiliate marketer as the chances of conversion is much higher. Not everyone will go on to take the extra step to verify the email after opting in.</p><h2>Adult Affiliate link Masking Explained</h2><p>People get starry eyes and start emailing me the step-by-step easiest way to make thousands of dollars in one month. The path is not so simple my friend. Promoting your adult affiliate offers and then receiving high quality converting traffic is difficult. Few of the problems faced are:</p><ol><li>Many web browser plugins prevent your affiliate offer to show</li><li>Also since all this is adult in nature, promoting such offers on Social media is very difficult as there are not so many adut-friendly social media network</li></ol><p>One great way or loophole to these problems is to Mask your adult affiliate link, or changing the appearance that no can tell about the original function of the link</p><h3><strong>Using URL shortners</strong></h3><p>One of the most common way of doing this is using URL shortners, which are freely available on the internet. You can use anyone, there are many available on the internet. Even Google themselves has a URL shortner of themselves, https://goo.gl/.</p><p>Yes you might think that wow, the problem is solved in such an easy way, but the road is not that smooth. Shortening the URL does make the URL look pretty but nowadays your web-broswers and social media websites can easily figure out the link behind these masked shortened urls and still make things difficult for us. So be wary of these, but most probably a url shorter will do the trick</p><h3><strong>Redirecting the link to your adult affiliate offer</strong></h3><p>One great solution to the above stated problems is using redirection. By simple sending visitors to an allowed or friendly url and then redirecting the url to your adult affiliate link is what is used by many these days.</p><p>Note: this is still not the best solution as your IP address might get banned or your URL also might get blacklisted</p><p>I personally use this simple but effective plugin <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/pretty-link/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pretty link</a> . This amazing plugin helps to create custom links which looks exactly as you want them to look. You can then easily redirect these custom links to your Adult affiliate links. Since these links look friendly and hence URL blockers wont block them, also you will easily bypass all the restriction on so many websites that are placed on adult affiliate links. Although i would recommend you to use the PRO version of the plugin to get the full functionality. The only issue you might face is that this plugin works with WordPress, so if you have a non-wordpress website then worry not there are other ways to use redirection as well.</p><h3><strong>Redirecting with .htaccess file</strong></h3><p>It is very simple, just add the following line:</p><p style="text-align: center;"><em>redirect 301 /custimLinkName http://adultaffiliatelink.com</em></p><p>Note: Be careful while editing .htaccess file, as even an additional white space can lead to website crashes.</p><p>One of the method of promoting your adult affiliate offer if Social media traffic. Because of the targeted nature of social media advertisements, targeting people on social media is a great way of making money through your adult affiliate offers. Facebook will ban your account very soon if you send the visitors directly to adult affiliate offers using your affiliate links and hence using the above tactic you can easily bypass the restriction</p><p>Note: Makemoneyadultcontent does not promote illegal or spamming. although the tactics shown above will work and also help people promote their adult affiliate offers, this does not mean we are promoting spamming. This method is for those good adult affiliate webmasters who have always played by the rules and are victims of other black hat adult webmasters that have misused other tactics to make money online<br/> We will be covering advertising on not so adult friendly social media network in the next upcoming week.</p><h2>Display Ads vs Adult Affiliate CPA programs</h2><p>This is an important topic because many adult webmasters are always confused which one to focus on. Monetizing methods are many, but choosing the right one that makes you the most money is important.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><h3>Which one can make me more money?</h3><p>This is the most asked question to me. Which one to choose and whether Display ads or Adult affiliate CPA programs will make me more money. If you are an adult webmaster, then you probably know that adult ads and adult CPA offers are the two most prominent ways of making money. I personally use a mixture of both of them to make my monthly income. Honestly the answer to this question is not absolute. It depends on many factors such as:</p><ol><li>Content and type of website</li><li>Traffic source</li><li>Money available to invest</li><li>Experience as an adult webmaster</li><li>Analytical skills</li></ol><p>The above list is just an overview of all the important points that matter when it comes about making money from adult websites. Display ads are the easiest and fastest way of making money if you already have a decent amount of audience. All you have to do is place the iframe code of the Adult ad (<a href="../juicyads-review-how-i-make-1000-per-month/index.html">Juicyads </a>or <a href="../exoclick-review/index.html">Exoclick</a>) on your website and you start making money. If you are someone who is satisfied with that dollar amount, then display ads is best suited for you. If you are like me who wants to make much more money and is willing to put that extra time, effort and money then Adult Affiliate Cap offers are best suited for you</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Many people have lost a lot of money in adult affiliate marketing, so you need to be smart and follow all my advice with focus in order to make money. It is not as easy as just putting ad code on your website</p><p>I do both because I never put all my apples in one basket, I like to diversify my income sources.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><h3>What are the major differences between Display Ads vs Adult Affiliate CPA programs?</h3><p>Although I have a separate section just for Affiliate marketing and adult media buying, (if you want to learn about making money through adult affiliate offers), I will still go over the few major difference.</p><p><strong>How you make money:</strong> You make through Adult display ads when someone clicks on your ads as well as the number of impression your ad gets. So if you have traffic and you place the ads on the right places in your website then instantly you will start making money. All you have to focus on is driving more traffic. In case of CPA based adult affiliate program you make money when you make a conversion.  Also the most profitable programs are revenue sharing CPA offers,.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><h3>How to maximize my income from display ads?</h3><p>To make the most from your adult deeply ads, you need to know the following points:</p><ol><li>Choosing the right categories while creating adult ad banners. For example, if your website is based on milfs but you choose teens category then the number of clicks on your ads will be significantly lower</li><li>Placing the ads on the right places and choosing the right ads.</li></ol><p><strong> </strong></p><h3>How to maximize my income from Adult CPA based affiliate programs?</h3><p>I cannot write one paragraph on this topic. it&#8217;s a fairly long topic and that I why I have created <a href="../category/adult-media-buy/index.html">Adult Media Buy</a> and<a href="../category/affiliate-programs/index.html"> Affiliate Marketing </a>sections on this website.

If you follow my advice and work hard then no one can stop you from making huge passive income in very less time. If you only devote 2-3 hours a week and expect to make $1000, then please forget it. initially it will take more effort but as soon as your website is set up, you will start witnessing a great inflow of profit, without much effort</p><p>Profitability is low compared to Adsense or affiliate marketing. But the best part about adult tube websites is that the traffic you get is huge which compensates for low CPC and hence you end up making good money. how much money you <span class="highlight">make</span> from the website depends on a many things—monetizing methods you are using, the country from where majority of your traffic is coming,and most importantly the amount of traffic you are getting</p><p>For the answer to your last question about entering into adult tube website business, i recommend you to read this whole article with 100% focus: <a href="../my-journey-to-3500-per-month-from-adult-tube-websites/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to Make $3500 per month</a></p><p><em><strong>what&#8217;s the best adult money making method?</strong></em></p><p>Honestly it depends on so many variables. There are countless methods over making money online through adult content. To choose one is extremely hard. I found adult tube websites to be good, and hence no i am making significant chunk of my earnings through them. I know people who are making much more than me through other adult methods.

There are many reasons behind it:</p><ul><li>Its free of cost</li><li>It is highly targeted. I mean the person coming to your website from search engines is actually searching for the content you are offering. So the chances of him becoming a repeat visitor are exponential.</li><li>Once you do your Adult Seo correctly, the traffic never stops. With paid traffic, it stops the moment you stop paying for it.</li></ul><p>Paid traffic is good, when you urgently need some traffic, but overall i would recommended you to avoid it and think from a long-term prospect. Although once used Juicyad and Plugrush for paid traffic, both of them are really good.</p><p><em><strong>What are the best and highest paying adult advertising networks:</strong></em></p><p>Well although there are many, but i will tell you the names of the ones i use and after many years of trial and error i have finalized them.

For the next Q/As, if you want any specific question to be answered then ask them in the comment section below.</p><h1>Making money through Adult Affiliate marketing &#8211; Mistakes and tips</h1><h2><strong>Creating misleading ads in your campaign</strong></h2><p>This is a very common mistake that newbie makes. If you create a banner that promotes a dating product with guaranteed result and no payment. But if someone clicks on the banner after loving the banner, and finds that he has to pay money then surely you will have a very high bounce off</p><p>Yes there will be high CTR or click-through rate, but you have to understand that the goal is not high CTR but high conversions. Even if you have high conversions with low CTR it is the best scenario</p><h2><strong>Not testing enough</strong></h2><p>This is a very critical part of any campaign. Testing is what you need to spend time in. Test various versions of you banners to find out which one converts the best. Going with just one banner and hoping magic will take place is a losing strategy. Test , test and test more to find the one that converts the most</p><p>Even a small change in color scheme, CTA or copy of your banner can change the CTR and conversions by a big amount</p><p>Testing is not just for banners but also for the landing page that you have created. Lets suppose that you have created a very Hight CTR banner, but your landing page is not enticing enough that people actually buy the product then it is all going to waste. Here A/B testing comes into play. usually avoided by newbies, but strongly recommended if you want to make it big in affiliate marketing</p><p>Test out various version of your landing page till the time you find the one that converts the most</p><h2><strong>Not asking for help</strong></h2><p>Newbies and beginners usually avoid this but this is a big mistake that they make. Building and profiting from a successful affiliate campaign requires perseverance, smartness and testing. Not asking for help from the affiliate company s support team, affiliate manager is a recipe for disaster.</p><p>They are there to help you and guide you in making you money. Because if you make money they will make money so they will be more than happy to help you more</p><h2><strong>Giving up too easily and moving  too fast</strong></h2><p>A very common trend in affiliate marketing as well. People come in with great enthusiasm, they lose some money , curse the system and then move on. This is the worst way of starting anything. You cannot become an expert within days, its takes time, mistakes, learnings before you start making some real cash</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Above i listed few mistakes that adult affiliate marketers make when starting their affiliate marketing CPA journey. Now i will be sharing some tops that will help you get successful in this industry and create a steady source of passive income</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Not reading the rules and Regulations</strong></h2><p>Every CPA network is different and has different set of rules ad guidelines. Before starting your campaign it is very important to first understand and go through what is allowed and what is not. Instead of getting banned later this small step can save to a lot of time and energy. affiliate network has to respect both publishers and their advertisers so make sure you do not violate any terms</p><h2><strong>Learnings both self and from others</strong></h2><p>One thing i have learned and accepted is that if you want to do anything in your life, having a mentor makes it super easy and saves a lot of time. For example, like hiring a trainer in the gym will save hundreds of hours of waste effort in exchange of some extra money being spent. similarly learning from the pros and people who are already doing it correctly is the best strategy.</p><p>So visit CPA blogs, forums and continuously talk to your affiliate manager. Email is your biggest weapon, so email as many people as you can find and learn from them. Politely ask for tips . See everyone loves to be acknowledged, and hence if you appreciate someone on their success and then ask for some clarifications then they will be glad to help</p><h2><strong>Research and be smart</strong></h2><p>Since you are adding banners to drive visitors to your landing page, you must check popular adult tube websites like pornhub and see which banners are driving people where. One smart trick is to check Juicyads and see the popular website and the ad zones that are sold for high bids. Then check out the banner of these adzones and the landing pages associated with them. This alone will give you a lot of inspiration and insights on how other&#8217;s are making money and the mistakes you are doing in your adult affiliate campaign</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2></h2><p>I hope you like this article on Making money through Adult Affiliate marketing &#8211; Mistakes and tips</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <br/> Cheers, <br/><br/> You can always reach me at <a href="../contact-us/index.html" target="_blank">Contact US</a> or through <strong> <a class="__cf_email__" href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" data-cfemail="93f0fcfde7f2f0e7d3fef2f8f6fefcfdf6eaf2f7e6ffe7f0fcfde7f6fde7bdf0fcfe">[email&#160;protected]</a><script data-cfhash='f9e31' type="text/javascript">/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */</script> </strong>for any queries.

At the same time start into adult media buying and with PPL offers. Although later on I will ask you to shift to PPS and on Revenue share but as of starting point you must start with PPL to get the revenue going\r\nCan I make money in adult affiliate marketing?\r\nIf you have been regularly following my website then you already know that money can be easily made in this niche. I have shared my earnings proof \u00a0in \u00a0multiple articles. Also if you are active on major forums then you know people are there who are making a killing in these niche.\r\nWhat are the websites that i need to sign up on to get started?\r\nHere are my favourites:\r\n\r\n \tExoticAds Review - Adult Display Advertising\r\n \tExoclick Review\r\n \tJuicyads Review \u2013 How i make $1000 per month\r\n \tPopads review \u2013 How i make $1500 per month\r\n \tPopcash review \u2013 How i make $900 per month\r\n\r\nTips for a newbie and a beginner?\r\n\r\n \tKeep this as a part-time hobby and wait till you are making \u00a0$1,000\/month to get serious about it.\r\n \tTesting is the key, so make sure you test all your campaigns when trying adult media buying for CPA (cost per action) offers\r\n \tDo not under-estimate the power of email marketing \u00a0(Adult Email Marketing - Build Mailing List and Make Money\u00a0)\r\n \tTry to learn from the pros, don't just take advice from anyone, rather try to establish relationship with people who are already making \u00a0a killing in Adult affiliate\r\n \tMake a good relationship with your account manager at Crakrevenue, they are really helpful\r\n \tDo not try any illegal stuff, and make sure you own the rights of everything you upload or work with.

If you have tested your campaign thoroughly (CTA, Landing page, Banner, Traffic sources) then you can easily get very cheap traffic converting very well for some amazing offers.\r\nWhat is DOI and SOI affiliate marketing terms\r\nHey hi all, i hope you are making money now. If you are just starting out in adult affiliate marketing then you might hear about the terms DOI and SOI affiliate opt-ins. To help you understand them better i have written this short post for you all\r\n\r\nWhen you talk about lead generation, or email capturing here is what these terms mean:\r\n\r\nDOI: Double opt-in. In DOI the user has to verify his email address by clicking on a special link that is sent to his entered email id after he\/she signs up on the offer website\r\n\r\nSOI: Single opt-in. This is where the person just needs to enter his email-id and does not needs to verify it.\r\n\r\nIt wont take much to understand that the SOI offer is much lucrative for affiliate marketer as the chances of conversion is much higher. Not everyone will go on to take the extra step to verify the email after opting in.\r\nAdult Affiliate link Masking Explained\r\nPeople get starry eyes and start emailing me the step-by-step easiest way to make thousands of dollars in one month. The path is not so simple my friend. Promoting your adult affiliate offers and then receiving high quality converting traffic is difficult. Few of the problems faced are:\r\n\r\n \tMany web browser plugins prevent your affiliate offer to show\r\n \tAlso since all this is adult in nature, promoting such offers on Social media is very difficult as there are not so many adut-friendly social media network\r\n\r\nOne great way or loophole to these problems is to Mask your adult affiliate link, or changing the appearance that no can tell about the original function of the link\r\nUsing URL shortners\r\nOne of the most common way of doing this is using URL shortners, which are freely available on the internet. You can use anyone, there are many available on the internet. Even Google themselves has a URL shortner of themselves,\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/.\r\n\r\nYes you might think that wow, the problem is solved in such an easy way, but the road is not that smooth. Shortening the URL does make the URL look pretty but nowadays your web-broswers and social media websites can easily figure out the link behind these masked shortened urls and still make things difficult for us. So be wary of these, but most probably a url shorter will do the trick\r\nRedirecting the link to your adult affiliate offer\r\nOne great solution to the above stated problems is using redirection. By simple sending visitors to an allowed or friendly url and then redirecting the url to your adult affiliate link is what is used by many these days.\r\n\r\nNote: this is still not the best solution as your IP address might get banned or your URL also might get blacklisted\r\n\r\nI personally use this simple but effective plugin Pretty link . This amazing plugin helps to create custom links which looks exactly as you want them to look. You can then easily redirect these custom links to your Adult affiliate links. Since these links look friendly and hence URL blockers wont block them, also you will easily bypass all the restriction on so many websites that are placed on adult affiliate links. Although i would recommend you to use the PRO version of the plugin to get the full functionality. The only issue you might face is that this plugin works with Wordpress, so if you have a non-wordpress website then worry not there are other ways to use redirection as well.\r\nRedirecting with .htaccess file\r\nIt is very simple, just add the following line:\r\nredirect 301 \/custimLinkName http:\/\/adultaffiliatelink.com\r\nNote: Be careful while editing .htaccess file, as even an additional white space can lead to website crashes.\r\n\r\nOne of the method of promoting your adult affiliate offer if Social media traffic. Because of the targeted nature of social media advertisements, targeting people on social media is a great way of making money through your adult affiliate offers. Facebook will ban your account very soon if you send the visitors directly to adult affiliate offers using your affiliate links and hence using the above tactic you can easily bypass the restriction\r\n\r\nNote: Makemoneyadultcontent does not promote illegal or spamming. although the tactics shown above will work and also help people promote their adult affiliate offers, this does not mean we are promoting spamming. This method is for those good adult affiliate webmasters who have always played by the rules and are victims of other black hat adult webmasters that have misused other tactics to make money online\r\nWe will be covering advertising on not so adult friendly social media network in the next upcoming week.\r\nDisplay Ads vs Adult Affiliate CPA programs\r\nThis is an important topic because many adult webmasters are always confused which one to focus on. Monetizing methods are many, but choosing the right one that makes you the most money is important.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhich one can make me more money?\r\nThis is the most asked question to me. Which one to choose and whether Display ads or Adult affiliate CPA programs will make me more money. If you are an adult webmaster, then you probably know that adult ads and adult CPA offers are the two most prominent ways of making money. I personally use a mixture of both of them to make my monthly income. Honestly the answer to this question is not absolute. It depends on many factors such as:\r\n\r\n \tContent and type of website\r\n \tTraffic source\r\n \tMoney available to invest\r\n \tExperience as an adult webmaster\r\n \tAnalytical skills\r\n\r\nThe above list is just an overview of all the important points that matter when it comes about making money from adult websites. Display ads are the easiest and fastest way of making money if you already have a decent amount of audience. All you have to do is place the iframe code of the Adult ad (Juicyads\u00a0or\u00a0Exoclick) on your website and you start making money. If you are someone who is satisfied with that dollar amount, then display ads is best suited for you. If you are like me who wants to make much more money and is willing to put that extra time, effort and money then Adult Affiliate Cap offers are best suited for you\r\n\r\nNote:\u00a0Many people have lost a lot of money in adult affiliate marketing, so you need to be smart and follow all my advice with focus in order to make money. It is not as easy as just putting ad code on your website\r\n\r\nI do both because I never put all my apples in one basket, I like to diversify my income sources.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhat are the major differences between Display Ads vs Adult Affiliate CPA programs?\r\nAlthough I have a separate section just for Affiliate marketing and adult media buying, (if you want to learn about making money through adult affiliate offers), I will still go over the few major difference.\r\n\r\nHow you make money:\u00a0You make through Adult display ads when someone clicks on your ads as well as the number of impression your ad gets. So if you have traffic and you place the ads on the right places in your website\u00a0then instantly you will start making money. All you have to focus on is driving more traffic. In case of CPA based adult affiliate program you make money when you make a conversion. \u00a0Also the most profitable programs are revenue sharing CPA offers,.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nHow to maximize my income from display ads?\r\nTo make the most from your adult deeply ads, you need to know the following points:\r\n\r\n \tChoosing the right categories while creating adult ad banners. For example, if your website is based on milfs but you choose teens category then the number of clicks on your ads will be significantly lower\r\n \tPlacing the ads on the right places and choosing the right ads.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nHow to maximize my income from\u00a0Adult CPA based affiliate programs?\r\nI cannot write one paragraph on this topic. it's a fairly long topic and that I why I have created\u00a0Adult Media Buy\u00a0and\u00a0Affiliate Marketing\u00a0sections on this website. I will request you to check all the article in this section and also keep checking the website for new articles to be added soon.

The format of this post will be simple, question followed by my answer.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1) Is it safe to enter this industry at this point of time? Will i be able to grow fast? What is your take on profitability? I was thinking of making a adult tube website, how much potential does it have?\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are following this website, and have read this whole article: \u00a0adult tube websites, then my friend you already know that i am making close to $5000 per month from all my adult money making websites. Its never too late to start, and YES it is absolutely safe to enter adult money making methods industry.\r\n\r\nThe scale and pace of how fast you will grow depends entirely on you. If you follow my advice and work hard then no one can stop you from making huge passive income in very less time. If you only devote 2-3 hours a week and expect to make $1000, then please forget it. initially it will take more effort but as soon as your website is set up, you will start witnessing a great inflow of profit, without much effort\r\n\r\nProfitability is low compared to Adsense or affiliate marketing. But the best part about adult tube websites is that the traffic you get is huge which compensates for low CPC and hence you end up making good money. how much money you make from the website depends on a many things\u2014monetizing methods you are using, the country from where majority of your traffic is coming,and most importantly the amount of traffic you are getting\r\n\r\nFor the answer to your last question about entering into adult tube website business, i recommend you to read this whole article with 100% focus: How to Make $3500 per month\r\n\r\nwhat's the best adult money making method?\r\n\r\nHonestly it depends on so many variables. There are countless methods over making money online through adult content. To choose one is extremely hard. I found adult tube websites to be good, and hence no i am making significant chunk of my earnings through them. I know people who are making much more than me through other adult methods. So it totally depends on you, which methods to choose until and unless you are willing to take action and use your brain to add a twist to make you method unique and profitable.\r\n\r\nWhat are the best ways to bringing traffic to an adult tube site?\r\n\r\nI personally prefer SEO so that i get continuous and uninterrupted supply of niche highly targeted traffic. But direct traffic also has the benefit of getting converted into a repeat visitor. I would request you ti go through ADULT SEO section of our website for the same., which has some great article to help you out in this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the best places to buy adult cpc traffic ?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs i mentioned earlier, i fouc on getting free organic traffic. There are many reasons behind it:\r\n\r\n \tIts free of cost\r\n \tIt is highly targeted. I mean the person coming to your website from search engines is actually searching for the content you are offering. So the chances of him becoming a repeat visitor are exponential.\r\n \tOnce you do your Adult Seo correctly, the traffic never stops. With paid traffic, it stops the moment you stop paying for it.\r\n\r\nPaid traffic is good, when you urgently need some traffic, but overall i would recommended you to avoid it and think from a long-term prospect. Although once used Juicyad and Plugrush for paid traffic, both of them are really good.\r\n\r\nWhat are the best and highest paying adult advertising networks:\r\n\r\nWell although there are many, but i will tell you the names of the ones i use and after many years of trial and error i have finalized them. I have written article about each one of theme here on this website, so would request you to read them.\r\n\r\n \tDisplay advertisement:\u00a0 Juicyads is the best . (Juicyads Review - How i make $1000 per month)\r\n \tPop-unders: Popads (Popads review - How i make $1500 per month) Popcash are the best ( Popcash review - How i make $900 per month)\r\n \tAffiliate Webcam website: Crakrevenue Review\r\n\r\nWhere can i find an exhaustive guide, guiding us on each step about making money money through adult content online? Questions like hosting, theme, settings, and everything else step by step with pics to make it easier for us?\r\n\r\nFor this reason itself i created this amazing article which will help you guide step-by-step about what steps to follow. How to Make $3500 per month from adult tube\u00a0.If you follow this article carefully, soon you will be making a very good passive income just like me.

It also covers the mistakes which i committed and how you can avoid them to speed up the whole process. I have also posted my earnings proof to motivate you that it is very easy making money online using adult methods.\r\n\r\nDoes adult traffic convert? what is your opinion about PPS (pay per signup) vs PPL (pay per lead)\r\n\r\nTypically people are so used to the dating offers advertisements, that converting or getting people to sign-up is extremely difficult. But none the less, even am making a major chunk of my revenue from dating offers. Personally i target PPS compared with PPL.\r\n\r\nWhich social media are best for adult\/porn traffic?\r\n\r\n\r\nI always recommend the power of social media, and it a great free platform for amazing traffic. Personally i use Youtube, Twitter, and Facebook. Youtube videos are a powerful way to drive traffic. Sometimes i also use Tumblr and Reddit as well\r\n\r\nI know that i have not answered all the questions, but i will make these kind of post as a series, once every month i will make one such post where i answer all your queries. For the next Q\/As, if you want any specific question to be answered then ask them in the comment section below.\r\nMaking money through Adult Affiliate marketing - Mistakes and tips\r\nCreating misleading ads in your campaign\r\nThis is a very common mistake that newbie makes. If you create a banner that promotes a dating product with guaranteed result and no payment. But if someone clicks on the banner after loving the banner, and finds that he has to pay money then surely you will have a very high bounce off\r\n\r\nYes there will be high CTR or click-through rate, but you have to understand that the goal is not high CTR but high conversions. Even if you have high conversions with low CTR it is the best scenario\r\nNot testing enough\r\nThis is a very critical part of any campaign. Testing is what you need to spend time in. Test various versions of you banners to find out which one converts the best. Going with just one banner and hoping magic will take place is a losing strategy. Test , test and test more to find the one that converts the most\r\n\r\nEven a small change in color scheme, CTA or copy of your banner can change the CTR and conversions by a big amount\r\n\r\nTesting is not just for banners but also for the landing page that you have created. Lets suppose that you have created a very Hight CTR banner, but your landing page is not enticing enough that people actually buy the product then it is all going to waste. Here A\/B testing comes into play. usually avoided by newbies, but strongly recommended if you want to make it big in affiliate marketing\r\n\r\nTest out various version of your landing page till the time you find the one that converts the most\r\nNot asking for help\r\nNewbies and beginners usually avoid this but this is a big mistake that they make. Building and profiting from a successful affiliate campaign requires perseverance, smartness and testing. Not asking for help from the affiliate company s support team, affiliate manager is a recipe for disaster.\r\n\r\nThey are there to help you and guide you in making you money. Because if you make money they will make money so they will be more than happy to help you more\r\nGiving up too easily and moving \u00a0too fast\r\nA very common trend in affiliate marketing as well. People come in with great enthusiasm, they lose some money , curse the system and then move on. This is the worst way of starting anything. You cannot become an expert within days, its takes time, mistakes, learnings before you start making some real cash\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAbove i listed few mistakes that adult affiliate marketers make when starting their affiliate marketing CPA journey. Now i will be sharing some tops that will help you get successful in this industry and create a steady source of passive income\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nNot reading the rules and Regulations\r\nEvery CPA network is different and has different set of rules ad guidelines. Before starting your campaign it is very important to first understand and go through what is allowed and what is not. Instead of getting banned later this small step can save to a lot of time and energy. affiliate network has to respect both publishers and their advertisers so make sure you do not violate any terms\r\nLearnings both self and from others\r\nOne thing i have learned and accepted is\u00a0that if you want to do anything in your life, having a mentor makes it super easy and saves a lot of time. For example, like hiring a trainer in the gym will save hundreds of hours of waste effort in exchange of some extra money being spent. similarly learning from the pros and people who are already doing it correctly is the best strategy.\r\n\r\nSo visit CPA blogs, forums and continuously talk to your affiliate manager. Email is your biggest weapon, so email as many people as you can find and learn from them. Politely ask for tips . See everyone loves to be acknowledged, and hence if you appreciate someone on their success and then ask for some clarifications then they will be glad to help\r\nResearch and be smart\r\nSince you are adding banners to drive visitors to your landing page, you must check popular adult tube websites like pornhub and see which banners are driving people where. One smart trick is to check Juicyads and see the popular website and the ad zones that are sold for high bids. Then check out the banner of these adzones and the landing pages associated with them.
