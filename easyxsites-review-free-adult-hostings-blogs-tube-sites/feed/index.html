<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this review.  I just tried easyXSites and I like it a lot.  The only thing is that I would like to customize the layout a bit more to make my site stand out.  I also couldn&#039;t get approved by 21sextury and DDF, because I guess the site needs to be established somewhat before they would accept it?

I wish I had found this earlier.  A few months ago, I created my own tube site using Adult Video Script.  It does require appox $250 investment upfront which is a lot.  But my website (http://www.honeytits.com) looks very much like PornHub, so that&#039;s an option for someone who has some investment capital and wants a fully custom website.]]></description>
