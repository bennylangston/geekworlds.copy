<description><![CDATA[What i say: 
If you are not a web developer, or you got 0 knowledge of php code, just keep away from nulled/cracked themes that they are out there. Most of them contain hidden lines of code, that in most cases will suspend or crash your server.
In other case if you can read/write code go on and build yours from 0 or modify your favorite theme.
But inspect it line by line.

Detube = dead end and a lot of errors on code ( not compatible with chrome, and a lot of new mods )
Tubeace = need a lot of work, and i accept with my friend here
Bestia = awesome, but out there there is a nulled version that is not the same, so watch out
Xtheme = if you like to have a clone look of xvideos go on
For the other themes i accept with the description]]></description>
