Just like you would be buying “ad spaces” or online advertisements, here you are not paying to promote yourself. Lets say you have a list of 100 people who might be interested in a product that you want to sell, so you send them all your offer or your product description and lets say 3-4 of these people end up buying your product, then this form of making money is known as Email Marketing</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly in adult industry, if you have a mailing list, then you can promote your Adult affiliate offers and make money of people who end up completing the action that you want them to complete. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best part about Email Marketing is that you are not paying any money to market your product (although first you need a highly responsive and quality email list)</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>How to Build a Mailing List?</h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The size and quality of your email list is your asset. How to obtain those email address, you might be wondering now. Let me give you an example: Think of the those websites that you visit that are related to your interest/hobbies/passion/liking (except social media of course). Lets say you are interested in learning guitar, and lets assume you are visiting abcdef.com for learning guitar. Most often than not you will see a pop up/widget/offer where something valuable is offered in exchange of your email id.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like “Learn 10 mistakes that you might be making while learning guitar, Signup up to get free PDF”. This is a perfect example of Leadmagnet (A lucrative offer in order to receive your email id)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly you on your own website will be doing everything to receive that precious email id of interested people.</span></p><h2>[Guide] Email Marketing for Adult Sites, Content – Networks, Companies and Services</h2><p>If you have an adult website (containing pornographic images, sexuality etc) then forget about finding a good email marketing company.

Yes mainstream companies like mailchimp prohibit us, also CANN_SPAM act has its own not-so friendly rules. But worry not, thousands of adult websites are sending millions of adult emails everyday. So how are they doing this, lets find out</p><p>There are two ways to go about Email marketing:</p><ol><li>Self hosting</li><li>Using a ESP or Email service Provider</li></ol><p>The choice to choose one between the two depends on many factors like Size of your adult email list, Money you are willing to spend, the convenience that yo are looking for</p><h3><strong>Adult email marketing using an email service provider</strong></h3><p>I have always preferred convenience over the extra effort that you need to put. If spending that extra few dollars are bringing me a great deal of convenience then I will obviously go for that. Here the ESP comes into play with their slick interface and amazing options and high deliverability you don’t need to worry about anything. The problem being that in adult entertainment industry or porn industry or escort industry or even webcam industry these normal ESP do not entertain adult content</p><p>Ynot mail comes as a great alternative, but they are charging a premium for their exclusive service. And why shouldn’t they, they ae the only one doing that in the market right now</p><p>Here are the advantages for using a ESP or email service provider for your adult email marketing efforts:</p><ol><li>Low initial cost as you don’t have to pay for servers, softwares etc.</li><li>Email list is managed by ESP</li><li>You don’t need to learn or hire a technical person to handle your self hosting requirements</li><li>You get the benefits of the experience of that company in email marketing and hence you get great templates, high deliverability, suggestions and many more amazing benefits</li></ol><p>The only disadvantage being high cost. If you have tens of thousand os people on your email list (first of kudos for such great list) but you will have to spend a lot o maintain that list in a ESP</p><h3><strong>Self hosted Adult email marketing</strong></h3><p>This is what most email marketers in adult industry and adult affiliate marketing use. A good autoresponder, own servers and SMTP server for delivery</p><p>The biggest advantage this borings is cost effectiveness and comes as a great alternative as ESP is not available. Since the cost increases with increase in size of list, using a self hosted solution will keep the cost same even if you have 100,000 people on your list. Imagine the cost for that with a ESP</p><p>The cost elements are:</p><ol><li>Autoresponder software (only one time payment)</li><li>Server cost</li><li>Cost of experienced professional if you don’t know a thing about all this</li></ol><p>Is you follow the CAN_SPAM rules and also Sender policy framework record, you wont be facing any problem with email deliverability.</p><p>The only extra thing you need to do is to make regular IP reputation check using the following free service <a href="http://mxtoolbox.com/blacklists.aspx">Ip blacklist check</a></p><p>Now you must have already decided which option suits you best.My guess is Self hosted solution, so the next question will be what is the best Self hosted email marketing software. Here are the two most popular softwares used by professional in adult space:</p><ol><li>AutoResponse Plus</li><li>Interspire</li></ol><h3><strong>Additional important knowledge for you all</strong></h3><p>Since you are doing email marketing for adult sites, I will recommend you to regularly check whether the IP address of he server is not blacklisted. You can easily do this using : http://mxtoolbox.com/blacklists.aspx</p><h2>How will I send these emails? Where will these emails get stored? How will i get the statistics of people opening my emails?</h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this you will need a dedicated email list manager, the one i recommend is Mailchimp (it is adult friendly). Although it&#8217;s a paid service, but you will get the to manage the first 2,000 subscribers for free (although with limited functionality)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is an excellent service to draft email campaigns, check open rates, build email capture widgets, etc</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>What does an Email Capture form or Leadmagnet looks like?</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating your email form is extremely crucial, and you must test it as much as possible to get the highest converting one. You must change the copy (test), display image, position etc to see which one performs the best. In the end your goal is to get maximum emails.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TIPS: </span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The copy of your email capture form must be highly enticing and must relate to the target audience. You must give your audience a reason to subscribe to your email list. People already are receiving multiple emails in their inbox, hence they will only subscribe only if they are highly interested.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep the form fields to the minimum, only the email id and name will suffice</span></li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Double opt-in vs Single opt-in?</h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must use Double opt-in compared with single opt-in to prevent yourself from considered as spam. This is the best way to reduce the spam complaints from people you will be sending your email campaigns to. Why Double opt-in is preferred because it wont allow people to put someone else email id as they need to click on verification link as well that will be sent to the email id they enter</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">you will see higher engagement rates as people took the extra step to confirm their email address and hence showing their interest in the content of the website</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Segmenting your Email list</h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This step is extremely crucial and lets know the interest of the people signing up. If you are sending emails of selling mobile phone to people who are looking for laptops than most probably they either wont open the email or just wont interact.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Email list segmentation helps improving the conversions, hence this step is crucial is success of your adult email marketing campaign</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can segment the list on various factors such as:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GEO Location</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opt-in Form</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open rate</span></li></ol><h2></h2><h2>Writing amazing emails for your adult email marketing campaign</h2><p>Although this topic looks trivial, but trust me this is very important. The story you tell with your words, your word choice, arrangements of different parts in your email, everything is crucial in your success. Since we are dealing in adult industry, you also need to focus on not getting your emails delivered to spam folder.</p><p>Let me go through this broad topic of writing effective adult marketing emails one by one</p><h4><strong>Preventing/Avoiding Email Spam Delivery</strong></h4><p>If you don&#8217;t know what spamming is then let me define it for you. If you send the same (irrelevant and unsolicited) message (email in our case) to a number of people without their permission. Email clients use many techniques to classify emails as spam or not, one is to look for shady words which give resemblance of spam. So you must avoid using these words in the content or title of your email. Although giving you a comprehensive list of all these spam words will be out of scope of this article , there are many good article on the internet which have complied such list.</p><p>Since we are dealing in adult industry le me give you some examples of such words: Sexy, big tits, milf etc,  you get my might i hope.</p><h4><strong>Writing amazing highly converting and engaging  Emails for you email list</strong></h4><p>Becoming a sales writer or drafting such emails takes experience. There are even specialists out these who are experts in writing highly converting emails and they charge a lot for their service. Worry not, you don&#8217;t need such elegance, you just need to get the job done.</p><p>The most common technique used online for writing effective emails is the use of <strong>AIDA. </strong>This is like a to-do list that you must follow in each email you write</p><ol><li><strong>Attention:</strong> Target and capture the attention of your audience</li><li><strong>Interest:</strong> First few lines and words are very important, this will help the person decide whether they want to read the rest of the content or not. Hence give them something interesting, a bait to read the rest</li><li><strong>Desire:</strong> Instead of stating the advantages of your product, target and focus on their desires, and how your offerings can fulfill those desires</li><li><strong>Action :</strong> Your call to action must be so good that the person should be bound to click on it</li></ol><p>Here are some additional tips that you must follow:</p><ol><li>Keep to one idea per phrase</li><li>Add the name of the person (you captured the name along with the email id). This makes the email look more humane and personal</li><li>Keep short sentences (20 words max)</li><li>Keep away from words that might get you in spam folder</li></ol><h4>Now let me give you the exact steps of writing your amazing Email</h4><ol><li>Title Matters a lot: A teasing and intriguing title does wonders to the open rate, so make sure your title is well thought of</li><li>Relating to the problems of the user: A person will only open you email if it offers them something that is missing in their life. If a person is interested in online business, but rather receives an email of online dating, its highly unlikely that he/she will open the email</li><li>Offer your solution: After you identify the problem, its you job to give the best solution possible</li><li>Give them reasons to choose your product/service : You don&#8217;t just have to introduce your product/service you wish to tell you audience exactly how and why your offering is what they want. Give testimonials, social proofs, use numbers instead of text (For ex: 85% of people have found their life partner using our service)</li><li>Tell them exactly what they will get: Make sure the user knows exactly what he/she will get in return of the money.</li><li>reassure and show authenticity: Studies have shown that offering money back guarantees have resulted in increased sales.</li><li>Use psychological hacks: Limited time offer, open to only first 1000 people, etc such techniques have worked wonders fo increasing sales</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Adult Template Email designing</h2><p>Template is important, it makes the difference. A great looking HTML template can work wonders for your email campaign. Remember the goal is to make the user buy whatever you are selling, hence you must optimize everything you can. Your email must be trustworthy, reliable, enticing, professional and friendly. Also a great design looks pleasing and makes the user more inclined to buy what you are offering. Follow the advice in the following steps:</p><h4><strong>Colors</strong></h4><p>Use tools such as <a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/" target="_blank">Adove color wheel</a> and <a href="http://paletton.com/" target="_blank">Paletton</a> for finding the right color combination for your template. Not just for email campaigns, even your website designs should showcase the niche of your website. If it is Hardcore (Bright red and black), pink for teen niche.</p><h4><strong>Layout should be correct</strong></h4><p>organization of your email is also very important. It should be readable, and aesthetically pleasing. Here are some tips for you:</p><ol><li>It should be under 800px</li><li>Choose one among Single Column Layout or Multi-column layout</li><li>Single Column Layout:<ol><li>Easy to read</li><li>Best suited for &#8220;Call to Action&#8221; type of emails</li><li>Best of conversational style emails</li></ol></li><li>Multi-column layout:<ol><li>E-commerce type emails are best for this</li><li>Helps in better display for content</li></ol></li></ol><h4><strong>Call to Action &#8211; The one area that will drive conversions</strong></h4><p>I wrote a full article on <a href="http://makemoneyadultcontent.com/creating-call-to-actions-adult-media-buying/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Creating Call to Actions – Adult Media Buying </a>. Call to action is all about standing out and grabbing attention. Usually it is in the form of a  button, and it should be clearly standing out from the rest.</p><h4><strong>HTML is the key </strong></h4><p>One mistake people might make is using image instead of HTML. This might land you in spam folder. Emails are scanned, before  they are delivered, and when you use an image, there is nothing to scan and the probably of your email landing in a spam folder is high. Make suer you content contribute at least 60% of the email.</p><h4><strong>Designing your template using Online tools</strong></h4><p>There are many tools available that can be used to organise the elements of your template.

You can expect a Return on Investment (ROI) of even 1,000% if your email marketing is spot on. If you are totally unaware about what a mailing list is and how to get one then keep on reading i will cover everything in detail.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis guide will help you understand\u00a0Adult Email Marketing in every adult niche:\r\n\r\n \tWebcam models\r\n \tAdult webmasters\r\n \tAdult affiliates\r\n \tAdult performers\r\n\r\nWhat is Email Marketing?\r\nIf you have a product\/service to sell, then pitching your offers to people on their email is what is known as email marketing. Just like you would be buying \u201cad spaces\u201d or online advertisements, here you are not paying to promote yourself. Lets say you have a list of 100 people who might be interested in a product that you want to sell, so you send them all your offer or your product description and lets say 3-4 of these people end up buying your product, then this form of making money is known as Email Marketing\r\n\r\nSimilarly in adult industry, if you have a mailing list, then you can promote your Adult affiliate offers and make money of people who end up completing the action that you want them to complete. \r\n\r\nThe best part about Email Marketing\u00a0is that you are not paying any money to market your product (although first you need a highly responsive and quality email list)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nHow to Build a Mailing List?\r\nThe size and quality of your email list is your asset. How to obtain those email address, you might be wondering now. Let me give you an example: Think of the those websites that you visit that are related to your interest\/hobbies\/passion\/liking (except social media of course). Lets say you are interested in learning guitar, and lets assume you are visiting abcdef.com for learning guitar. Most often than not you will see a pop up\/widget\/offer where something valuable is offered in exchange of your email id.\r\n\r\nLike \u201cLearn 10 mistakes that you might be making while learning guitar, Signup up to get free PDF\u201d. This is a perfect example of Leadmagnet (A lucrative offer in order to receive your email id)\r\n\r\nSimilarly you on your own website will be doing everything to receive that precious email id of interested people.\r\n[Guide] Email Marketing for Adult Sites, Content \u2013 Networks, Companies and Services\r\nIf you have an adult website (containing pornographic images, sexuality etc) then forget about finding a good email marketing company. Email marketing is the most crucial and important part of Internet marketing. Today I will tell you how to do Email Marketing for Adult Sites\r\n\r\nIf you own an adult website or have adult content on your site then sooner or later you will be thinking about incorporating Email marketing. After doing some research you will find out that none of the major Email marketing companies like Mailchimp, Aweber does not allow adult content.\r\n\r\nEven if you are thinking of doing Adult affiliate marketing for making money even then you will need a solid email marketing company to handle everything. Making money through Adult affiliate marketing requires you to have an amazing email marketing plan, so it becomes even more crucial for you.\r\n\r\n(Check out the following helpful and additional articles that will help you get started in adult affiliate marketing :\u00a0Adult affiliate marketing Make Easy Money\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo then you will have the following questions in you mind:\r\n\r\n \tHow can I do email marketing for my adult website\r\n \tBest Email marketing company for adult sites\r\n\r\nWhen I was doing reasearch for this article,\u00a0 found out that not much information is available on this topic. Even forum threads does not give a satisfactory answer to users problems. So I decided to do even more research and also incorporate my experience in order to make this a one stop solution article for anyone facing this problem\r\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t want to do any hard work and are ready to shell out some money then the best solution for you is \u201cYnot Mail\u201d. This is the only reliable Adult email marketing software on the internet. It incorporates all the features that a good ESP like Mailchimp offers.\r\n\r\nThe only downside is it being insanely expensive. Compared to non-adult ESP the prices are almost double. I will soon be writing a comprehensive review of this service till then you can check the comparison of prices of Ynotmail compared with other companies in this space :\r\n\r\nMailchimp pricing:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYnot pricing:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter reading this brief intro that I have given you might be feeling hopeless or really frustrated that why the hell is it so difficult for adult sites to do email marketing. Yes mainstream companies like mailchimp prohibit us, also CANN_SPAM act has its own not-so friendly rules. But worry not, thousands of adult websites are sending millions of adult emails everyday. So how are they doing this, lets find out\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to go about Email marketing:\r\n\r\n \tSelf hosting\r\n \tUsing a ESP or Email service Provider\r\n\r\nThe choice to choose one between the two depends on many factors like Size of your adult email list, Money you are willing to spend, the convenience that yo are looking for\r\nAdult email marketing using an email service provider\r\nI have always preferred convenience over the extra effort that you need to put. If spending that extra few dollars are bringing me a great deal of convenience then I will obviously go for that. Here the ESP comes into play with their slick interface and amazing options and high deliverability\u00a0you don\u2019t need to worry about anything. The problem being that in adult entertainment industry or porn industry or escort industry or even webcam industry these normal ESP do not entertain adult content\r\n\r\nYnot mail comes as a great alternative, but they are charging a premium for their exclusive service. And why shouldn\u2019t they, they ae the only one doing that in the market right now\r\n\r\nHere are the advantages for using a ESP or email service provider for your adult email marketing efforts:\r\n\r\n \tLow initial cost as you don\u2019t have to pay for servers, softwares etc.\r\n \tEmail list is managed by ESP\r\n \tYou don\u2019t need to learn or hire a technical person to handle your self hosting requirements\r\n \tYou get the benefits of the experience of that company in email marketing and hence you get great templates, high deliverability, suggestions and many more amazing benefits\r\n\r\nThe only disadvantage being high cost. If you have tens of thousand os people on your email list (first of kudos for such great list) but you will have to spend a lot o maintain that list in a ESP\r\nSelf hosted Adult email marketing\r\nThis is what most email marketers in adult industry and adult affiliate marketing use. A good autoresponder, own servers and SMTP server for delivery\r\n\r\nThe biggest advantage this borings is cost effectiveness and comes as a great alternative as ESP is not available. Since the cost increases with increase in size of list, using a self hosted solution will keep the cost same even if you have 100,000 people on your list. Imagine the cost for that with a ESP\r\n\r\nThe cost elements are:\r\n\r\n \tAutoresponder software (only one time payment)\r\n \tServer cost\r\n \tCost of experienced professional if you don\u2019t know a thing about all this\r\n\r\nIs you follow the CAN_SPAM rules and also Sender policy framework record, you wont be facing any problem with email deliverability.\r\n\r\nThe only extra thing you need to do is to make regular IP reputation check using the following free service Ip blacklist check\r\n\r\nNow you must have already decided which option suits you best.My guess is Self hosted solution, so the next question will be what is the best Self hosted email marketing software. Here are the two most popular softwares used by professional in adult space:\r\n\r\n \tAutoResponse Plus\r\n \tInterspire\r\n\r\nAdditional important knowledge for you all\r\nSince you are doing email marketing for adult sites, I will recommend you to regularly check whether the IP address of he server is not blacklisted. You can easily do this using\u00a0:\u00a0http:\/\/mxtoolbox.com\/blacklists.aspx\r\nHow will I send these emails? Where will these emails get stored? How will i get the statistics of people opening my emails?\r\nFor this you will need a dedicated email list manager, the one i recommend is Mailchimp (it is adult friendly). Although it's a paid service, but you will get the to manage the first 2,000 subscribers for free (although with limited functionality)\r\n\r\nThis is an excellent service to draft email campaigns, check open rates, build email capture widgets, etc\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nWhat does an Email Capture form or Leadmagnet looks like?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nCreating your email form is extremely crucial, and you must test it as much as possible to get the highest converting one. You must change the copy (test), display image, position etc to see which one performs the best. In the end your goal is to get maximum emails.\r\n\r\nTIPS: \r\n\r\n \tThe copy of your email capture form must be highly enticing and must relate to the target audience. You must give your audience a reason to subscribe to your email list. People already are receiving multiple emails in their inbox, hence they will only subscribe only if they are highly interested.\r\n \tKeep the form fields to the minimum, only the email id and name will suffice\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nDouble opt-in vs Single opt-in?\r\nYou must use Double opt-in compared with single opt-in to prevent yourself from considered as spam. This is the best way to reduce the spam complaints from people you will be sending your email campaigns to. Why Double opt-in is preferred because it wont allow people to put someone else email id as they need to click on verification link as well that will be sent to the email id they enter\r\n\r\nAlso,  you will see higher engagement rates as people took the extra step to confirm their email address and hence showing their interest in the content of the website\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nSegmenting your Email list\r\nThis step is extremely crucial and lets know the interest of the people signing up. If you are sending emails of selling mobile phone to people who are looking for laptops than most probably they either wont open the email or just wont interact.\r\n\r\nEmail list segmentation helps\u00a0improving the conversions, hence this step is crucial is success of your adult email marketing campaign\r\n\r\nYou can segment the list on various factors such as:\r\n\r\n \tGEO Location\r\n \tOpt-in Form\r\n \tOpen rate\r\n\r\n\r\nWriting amazing emails for your adult email marketing campaign\r\nAlthough this topic looks trivial, but trust me this is very important. The story you tell with your words, your word choice, arrangements of different parts in your email, everything is crucial in your success. Since we are dealing in adult industry, you also need to focus on not getting your emails delivered to spam folder.\r\n\r\nLet me go through this broad topic of writing effective adult marketing emails one by one\r\nPreventing\/Avoiding Email Spam Delivery\r\nIf you don't know what spamming is then let me define it for you. If you send the same (irrelevant and unsolicited) message (email in our case) to a number of people without their permission. Email clients use many techniques to classify emails as spam or not, one is to look for shady words which give resemblance of spam. So you must avoid using these words in the content or title of your email. Although giving you a comprehensive list of all these spam words will be out of scope of this article , there are many good article on the internet which have complied such list.\r\n\r\nSince we are dealing in adult industry le me give you some examples of such words: Sexy, big tits, milf etc, \u00a0you get my might i hope.\r\nWriting amazing highly converting and\u00a0engaging \u00a0Emails for you email list\r\nBecoming a sales writer or drafting such emails takes experience. There are even specialists out these who are experts in writing highly converting emails and they charge a lot for their service. Worry not, you don't need such elegance, you just need to get the job done.\r\n\r\nThe most common technique used online for writing effective emails is the use of AIDA.\u00a0This is like a to-do list that you must follow in each email you write\r\n\r\n \tAttention: Target and capture the attention of your audience\r\n \tInterest: First few lines and words are very important, this will help the person decide whether they want to read the rest of the content or not. Hence give them something interesting, a bait to read the rest\r\n \tDesire: Instead of stating the advantages of your product, target and focus on their desires, and how your offerings can fulfill those desires\r\n \tAction : Your call to action must be so good that the person should be bound to click on it\r\n\r\nHere are some additional tips that you must follow:\r\n\r\n \tKeep to one idea per phrase\r\n \tAdd the name of the person (you captured the name along with the email id). This makes the email look more humane and personal\r\n \tKeep short sentences (20 words max)\r\n \tKeep away from words that might get you in spam folder\r\n\r\nNow let me give you the exact steps of writing your amazing Email\r\n\r\n \tTitle Matters a lot: A teasing and intriguing title does wonders to the open rate, so make sure your title is well thought of\r\n \tRelating to the problems of the user: A person will only open you email if it offers them something that is missing in their life. If a person is interested in online business, but rather receives an email of online dating, its highly unlikely that he\/she will open the email\r\n \tOffer your solution: After you identify the problem, its you job to give the best solution possible\r\n \tGive them reasons to choose your product\/service : You don't just have to introduce your product\/service you wish\u00a0to tell you audience exactly how and why your offering is what they want. Give testimonials, social proofs, use numbers instead of text (For ex: 85% of people have found their life partner using our service)\r\n \tTell them exactly what they will get: Make sure the user knows exactly what he\/she will get in return of the money.\r\n \treassure and show authenticity: Studies have shown that offering money back guarantees have resulted in increased sales.\r\n \tUse psychological hacks: Limited time offer, open to only first 1000 people, etc such techniques have worked wonders fo increasing sales\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAdult Template Email designing\r\nTemplate is important, it makes the difference. A great looking HTML template can work wonders for your email campaign. Remember the goal is to make the user buy whatever you are selling, hence you must optimize everything you can. Your email must be trustworthy, reliable, enticing, professional and friendly. Also a great design looks pleasing and makes the user more inclined to buy what you are offering. Follow the advice in the following steps:\r\nColors\r\nUse tools such as Adove color wheel\u00a0and Paletton\u00a0for finding the right color combination for your template. Not just for email campaigns, even your website designs should showcase the niche of your website. If it is Hardcore (Bright red and black), pink for teen niche.\r\nLayout should be correct\r\norganization of your email is also very important. It should be readable, and aesthetically pleasing. Here are some tips for you:\r\n\r\n \tIt should be under 800px\r\n \tChoose one among Single Column Layout or Multi-column layout\r\n \tSingle Column Layout:\r\n\r\n \tEasy to read\r\n \tBest suited for \"Call to Action\" type of emails\r\n \tBest of conversational style emails\r\n\r\n\r\n \tMulti-column layout:\r\n\r\n \tE-commerce type emails are best for this\r\n \tHelps in better display for content\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCall to Action - The one area that will drive conversions\r\nI wrote a full article on Creating Call to Actions \u2013 Adult Media Buying\u00a0. Call to action is all about standing out and grabbing attention. Usually it is in the form of a \u00a0button, and it should be clearly standing out from the rest.\r\nHTML is the key\u00a0\r\nOne mistake people might make is using image instead of HTML. This might land you in spam folder. Emails are scanned, before \u00a0they are delivered, and when you use an image, there is nothing to scan and the probably of your email landing in a spam folder is high. Make suer you content contribute at least 60% of the email.\r\nDesigning your template using Online tools\r\nThere are many tools available that can be used to organise the elements of your template. After figuring out the colors, the layout, and content of the template, organising them is made easier with online tools such as Template Builder . An amazing tool to build this template.\r\n\r\nTip: Also make sure, you make the template and email responsive. Using Responsive Email\r\n\r\nMust Follow steps before you send your first email\r\nCompatibility with email providers\r\n\r\nA great service known ad Email on Acid is a great way of testing your email (preview your email) of various different email clients (as well as on mobile devices)\r\nKnowing your Spam Score\r\nSpam score is used to calculate the likeliness of your email landing in the Spam folder. It is a scale from 0 to 10. \"0\"\u00a0being the best, meaning you should be aiming for 0\r\nIp address affecting your spam score\r\nSenderScore is a great resource to find out where your IP address has been blacklisted. If your spam score is high, a major reason could be that your IP address is blacklisted. A score of 85 or above tells you that you can continue sending emails. Sendscore will analyze your IP address to give you a score\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI hope you like this article on Adult Email Marketing - Build Mailing List and Make Money","image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http:\/\/www.makemoneyadultcontent.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Adult-Email-Marketing-Build-Mailing-List-and-Make-Money.jpg","width":696,"height":200}}</script> </article><p class="post-tag">Tags <a href="../tag/adult-email-marketing/index.html" rel="tag">Adult Email Marketing</a> <a href="../tag/email-campaigns/index.html" rel="tag">email campaigns</a> <a href="../tag/email-marketing/index.html" rel="tag">Email Marketing</a> <a href="../tag/mailing-list/index.html" rel="tag">mailing list</a></p><div class="e3lan e3lan-post"><a target="_blank" href="https://makemoneyadultcontent.leadpages.co/leadbox/14626b373f72a2%3A14747c717f46dc/5749563331706880/"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Dn3hzL9m4ABJYGU8MSCyIPo34oa1xsfqiqb8OitS78a5B6QS9D-tZscWcEWaBhzgSCCLTLCbM_gQ54w0oX9Ztw=s0"></a></div> <section id="author-box"><div class="block-head"><h3>About Make money adult content</h3><div class="stripe-line"></div></div><div class="post-listing"><div class="author-bio"><div class="author-avatar"> <img alt='' src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=" data-lazy-src='http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3a4ac1ecad7966acdddbb09bc560571f?s=90&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g' data-lazy-srcset='http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3a4ac1ecad7966acdddbb09bc560571f?s=180&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-90 photo' height='90' width='90'/><noscript><img alt='' src='http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3a4ac1ecad7966acdddbb09bc560571f?s=90&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g' srcset='http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3a4ac1ecad7966acdddbb09bc560571f?s=180&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-90 photo' height='90' width='90'/></noscript></div><div class="author-description"> Hi, I have been making money from adult content from last 5 years now.

This website is a way to pass my knowledge and leanings to all the people who wants to earn some passive income. I have a network or almost 20 adult websites which make more than $10,000 per month. This includes adult websites, webcam models, clipstore models, porn production etc etc. If you have a willingness to earn some extra cash then do take each article seriously and get up off your lazy ass and start taking some action.
