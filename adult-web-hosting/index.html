I am making more money than i ever imagined.</p><p>I wish i had someone who can guide me (like i am doing for you guys). I learned everything by my own and now i have <strong>30+ successful running</strong> money making websites.</p><p>If you are serious about making money online, then follow this one single advice of mine: Buy a <a href="../recommends/hostgator/index.html">Hostgator hosting </a>and change your life for good.</p><h2><strong>Why did i shift from Godaddy to Hostgator for my 30+ Adult sites?</strong></h2><p>Till January 2016 i had no issues with Godaddy. They were doing fine, but this year they have just been greedy and the server performance was worst than ever. Not just one server, my websites had different GoDaddy accounts and all of them faced the similar issue:</p><ol><li>extremely slow websites ( 10-15 seconds loading time)</li><li>Frequent website crashes</li><li>Unhelpful support</li></ol><p>Few of my tube websites gets <strong>600,000 visits /month</strong> and even a one-day website crash means losing hundreds of dollars of money. Also i have various webcam sites, and other adult oriented services website and such problems (slow sites, frequent crashing) was just not acceptable.</p><p>Then i decided to find the best adult hosting companies for all my adult websites. This time i wanted to be sure since a huge time investment is required in moving 30+ websites from one hosting company to another.</p><p>After researching i made a list of best adult web hosting companies and 3 companies came up in my list:</p><ol><li>Siteground (adult content not allowed)</li><li>Bluehost (adult content not allowed)</li><li><strong>Hostgator (adult content is allowed)</strong></li><li>DreamHost (adult allowed but performace ver poor)</li></ol><p>So after doing some more research and asking few of my friends in adult industry i decided to shift 3 of my high traffic websites to <a href="../recommends/hostgator/index.html">Hostgator WordPress business host8ing</a></p><p>What was my reaction after 2 days of testing: <strong>OH MY GOD IT IS AMAZING 🙂</strong></p><p>Here is what happened to my websites:</p><ol><li>Websites was loading at blazing fast speed</li><li>Organic traffic increased by 20% and also on site time improved a lot because of faster website</li><li>I even checked with support to see how they resolve any query and their quality.And even Hostgator support is very friendly and helpful</li></ol><h2><strong>Why so many benefits in Hostgator business WordPress hosting for Adult sites?</strong></h2><p>Hostgator has come up with this new shared business WordPress hosting so that people can enjoy the benefits of cloud hosting at fraction of cost.

I think that i have not covered this topic correctly and it needs to be discussed in the right manner. Although i have recommended using godaddy in my <a href="../my-journey-to-3500-per-month-from-adult-tube-websites/index.html">How to Make $3500 per month from adult tube websites</a> guide, but over the years godaddy has really degraded their performance and their hosting sucks big time now.</p><p>Adult entertainment industry is growing rapidly and it is forecasted to grow even further till 2020. It has bright future and with te advent of technology and its integration with adult entertainment , new avenues have opened up and people are rushing in to make the most money in this wave. This is the perfect time to jump in and start your own adult company or business to make easy money online. Before starting the first thing you will need is a porn hosting or an adult friendly web hosting. Today in this article i discuss about the best adult hosting companies on the internet and which one to choose.</p><p>Let me give you a list of adult friendly web hosting. Not every web hosting company allows adult content. Let me first define what constitutes adult content:</p><ol><li>Any websites that promotes or shows nudity</li><li>Porn websites, camming websites, adult image boards, tube websites, adult landing pages</li><li>Casino, betting are also considered adult in nature by many web hosting providers</li></ol><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> Remember child pornography, bestiality , rape, snuff and other similar areas are illegal and hence you might face jail term if your indulge in these</em></p><p>So if you are following any of the guide on my website then you will need an adult friendly web hosting to start your website, along with the adult domain name. I have compiled a list of all the adult hostings that will allow adult content on their servers:</p><p>If you start your porn site or adult website on a website hosting provider that does not allow adult content or porn sites, then very soon your website will get banned and all your hard work will be lost. You wont even be allowed to take the backup in order to transfer your website. So make sure you check the TOS (terms of service) and Privacy policy of every web hosting company before joining. If you choose any company from the above list you don&#8217;t have to worry about anything, as they allow adult content on their servers</p><h2><strong>Whats the difference between a normal web hosting and adult site web hosting/porn hosting?</strong></h2><p>Since not all of the web hosting companies want to associate themselves with content that is adult orientated or adult in nature so they do not allow adult content on their servers. Companies like Bluehost, Siteground which are well established and have big names in hosting space stay away from adult oriented websites</p><h2>What is the best Adult web hosting, porn site hosting? Which hosting do you recommend?</h2><p>I have been in the adult industry for more than 6 years now and trust me i have tried many different web hosting. Although there are many hosting that is specific for one particular type of websites. Like if you are looking for a webcam streaming then you need a VPS or a very high power hosting. But for normal adult websites, the one that I recommend and personally use for almost 30+ adult websites of mine is : <a href="../recommends/hostgator/index.html">Hostgator cloud business hosting</a></p><p>I wrote a complete review for the same check it out: <strong><a class="row-title" href="../hostgator-review-best-web-hosting-adult-porn-websites.html">Hostgator Review – Best Web hosting for Adult sites/ porn websites</a> </strong> . In this article i tell you why hostgator is the best and the best steps to buy this cheap high power cloud wordpress hosting. The article also has a coupon code that will help you save 25% of total cost, so hurry and grab that coupon now.</p><h1 style="text-align: center;"><a href="../recommends/hostgator/index.html">Buy hostgator hosting for adult webiste now</a></h1><h2><strong>Can i use these companies for Adult video hosting?</strong></h2><p>Majority of the adult websites, be it webcam websites, adult tube websites, clip selling websites work on storage. They need a lot of storage in order to handle those heavy and big adult videos and images. Hence you need vast storage and speedy website for your visitors. Adult video hosting providers listed in this article will help you in that. But still before signing up make sure you talk to the sales representative and tell him your requirements. As unlimited storage and unlimited bandwidth is crucial for your adult website.</p><h2><strong>What is the difference between shared and VPS adult website hosting?</strong></h2><p>VPS stands for Virtual private server and is used by heavy high traffic websites. When you are using a shared hosting for your adult website then you are competing with hundreds of other websites on that particular server for resources. Because of this limitation shared hosting are cheap. Adult shared web hosting is used by websites which are new or just starting out since the resource requirement is not that great.</p><p>adult VPS web hosting is used by companies which get thousands of visitors per month. Since to handle such huge traffic they need dedicated resources and hence need a Virtual private server. You must know one thing that working with a VPS requires the expertise of a professional who can set up the VPS for your website and also can take care of day-to-day technical requirements. Shared hosting can easily be managed even by a normal non-technical person like you and me. Because of dedicated resources, these VPS hostings are expensive compared to a shared hosting</p><p>So go for Adult VPS website hosting only when you have a high traffic website and need your website to run smoothly even if thousands of visitors visit your website at a time. With shared hosting, the growth of your website will be limited.</p><p>What are the advantages of Adult VPS hosting:</p><ol><li>High-speed servers and resource availability</li><li>Huge bandwidth and disk space</li><li>You are not competing with any other website for bandwidth and resource availability</li><li>VPS can be easily scaled, if you think you website needs more resources then you can easily upgrade your VPS to even better configuration just by paying more</li><li>Many companies allow Adult content on their VPS but not on shared hosting</li><li>Page loading speed improved tremendously and hence you website will be preferred by Google in terms of search engine rankings</li></ol><h2><strong>What should i keep in mind before buying my adult web hosting?</strong></h2><p>Here is a list of all the things you keep in mind before opting for your adult hosting company:</p><ol><li>Some companies charge yearly and some monthly and some pay as you go service. So decide which one suits you the best. Also make sure you properly check the refund policy (companies usually have a one month refund policy) so that if you don&#8217;t like the hosting performance you are able to get he full refund without any hassle. <strong>(i recommend <a href="../recommends/hostgator/index.html">Hostgator</a>)</strong></li><li>Go for a reputed adult hosting company. Companies like  Arvixe and Coolhandle as they have been in the game for a long time and are reliable but hostgator has came across the best. They are also not heavy on the pocket and have enough experience in the adult space. <strong>(i recommend <a href="../recommends/hostgator/index.html">Hostgator</a>)</strong></li><li>Customer service is a big part in any hosting provider. So make sure that the customer representatives are friendly, knowledgeable and your queries are handled easily and perfectly <strong>(i recommend <a href="../recommends/hostgator/index.html">Hostgator</a>)</strong></li></ol><p>There are many adult web hosting companies that will suit your desires and are high in performance.

So yes, buying a Hostgator Hosting will be the best decision you can make.\r\n\r\nEarlier, over the last year, i have always recommended Godaddy hosting for all my adult websites.\u00a0\r\n\r\nBut honestly, the performance of Godaddy has degraded to such a pathetic level over the last few months (since May 2016) that I was forced to move all my adult websites to Hostgaotor Wordpress Hosting\u00a0. This is why I decided to update my visitors by writing this Hostgator review.\r\nBuy Hostgator Business Hosting NOW\r\n\r\nHow A $100 investment is giving me 10,000% ROI each month:\r\nI invested $100 into a hosting service 7 years back and after struggling, learning and implementing the strategies that i teach here on makemoneyadultcontent.com, now i can happily say that $100 was the best investment decision ever. I am making more money than i ever imagined.\r\n\r\nI wish i had someone who can guide me (like i am doing for you guys). I learned everything by my own and now i have 30+ successful running\u00a0money making websites.\r\n\r\nIf you are serious about making money online, then follow this one single advice of mine: Buy a Hostgator hosting and change your life for good.\r\nWhy did i shift from Godaddy to Hostgator for my 30+ Adult sites?\r\nTill January 2016 i had no issues with Godaddy. They were doing fine, but this year they have just been greedy and the server performance was worst than ever. Not just one server, my websites had different GoDaddy accounts and all of them faced the similar issue:\r\n\r\n \textremely slow websites ( 10-15 seconds loading time)\r\n \tFrequent website crashes\r\n \tUnhelpful support\r\n\r\nFew of my tube websites gets 600,000 visits \/month and even a one-day website crash means losing hundreds of dollars of money. Also i have various webcam sites, and other adult oriented services website and such problems (slow sites, frequent crashing) was just not acceptable.\r\n\r\nThen i decided to find the best adult hosting companies for all my adult websites. This time i wanted to be sure since a huge time investment is required in moving 30+ websites from one hosting company to another.\r\n\r\nAfter researching i made a list of best adult web hosting companies and 3 companies came up in my list:\r\n\r\n \tSiteground (adult content not allowed)\r\n \tBluehost (adult content not allowed)\r\n \tHostgator (adult content is allowed)\r\n \tDreamHost (adult allowed but performace ver poor)\r\n\r\nSo after doing some more research and asking few of my friends in adult industry i decided to shift 3 of my high traffic websites to Hostgator Wordpress business host8ing\r\n\r\nWhat was my reaction after 2 days of testing: OH MY GOD IT IS AMAZING :)\r\n\r\nHere is what happened to my websites:\r\n\r\n \tWebsites was loading at blazing fast speed\r\n \tOrganic traffic increased by 20% and also on site time improved a lot because of faster website\r\n \tI even checked with support to see how they resolve any query and their quality.And even Hostgator support is very friendly and helpful\r\n\r\nWhy so many benefits in Hostgator business WordPress hosting for Adult sites?\r\nHostgator has come up with this new shared business WordPress hosting so that people can enjoy the benefits of cloud hosting at fraction of cost. It is 2.5x faster because of cloud hosting. Also, bandwidth is unmetered so that is a huge advantage as well. You will also get advanced security and also priority support - two very important things\r\n\r\nSo what i did next: \u00a0Shifted all my adult websites to Hostgator and now i am very happy with the result. Yes, i am a little sad for extra money that i had to spend but it was totally worth it. I hate you GoDaddy :D\r\n\r\nMy life , my livelihood, depends on my website. My websites are my bread and butter. All the real money i have made is because of my websites. I would not have seen or even dreamt of numbers like these in my bank account:\r\nAre you looking for a cheap Adult or porn hosting for your adult porn website?\r\nalthough there are many options available, but Hostgator is cheapest among them and also since the company is huge and have been in the industry for long so you can easily trust them. Now i will give you an exact step-by-step article on how to buy and start your adult website today\r\n\r\nIf you think about a decade behind\u00a0then creating a website was extremely difficult because of the technicalities involved. Nowadays it has become so easy and convenient to start a porn website that anyone can create and make their adult website, or blog\r\n\r\nI will go step by step and try to explain everything in a simple and easy manner\r\n\r\nThings you need:\r\n\r\n \tAdult friendly hosting - I recommend Hostgator since they are affordable and supports porn hosting\r\n \tDomain name with WHOIS support - It comes free with hosting\r\n \tWordPress installation - Free again\r\n \tAdult tube theme - I Recommend detube theme\r\n \tYour patience to read this article and also many more articles on this website as i share some amazing tips and tricks how to make real big money in adult space\r\n\r\nHostgator Review - Best Web hosting for Adult sites\/ adult porn websites\r\nHow to buy adult porn and adult friendly Hostgator hosting - step-by-step guide\r\nYou can visit the Hostgator Homepage through following link: Hostgator Porn hosting\u00a0\r\n\r\nClick the Wordpress Hosting, see image below\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough shared web hosting plans are cheaper, but this word press specific hosting comes with power packed features that are worth the few dollars extra. I will highly recommend going for WordPress hosting as it will reap in many benefits later\r\n\r\nThere are three plans available:\r\n\r\n \tStarter Plan\r\n \tStandard Plan\r\n \tBusiness plan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow you might be tempted to buy the cheapest one that is starter\u00a0plan. If i would have been in your position than i would have done the same. But let me tell you few things before that. If you go for starter plan then you can only host one website on your hosting and that will become a nuisance as the moment you think of starting another website you will have to buy another hosting\r\n\r\nAlso i am very sure once someone enters this online business world creating multiple websites become mandatory for scaling your business and making more money. I myself have almost 30+ websites right now, (few tube sites, adult blogs, adult affiliate sites, webcam sites etc). No i keep my high traffic adult tube sites on Hostgaotor business plan and all my other websites on Hostgator cloud hosting (that if more expensive and is required by experienced people like me)\r\n\r\nThe decision is yours but i will recommend you to for Business hostagor hosting . Click on the Buy now button\r\nChoosing an adult or porn domain name for your website\r\nI hope you have already figured out the domain name if not then check this guide:\u00a0Buying SEO friendly adult domain name\u00a0and\u00a0How to choose a domain name for your website\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNow once you are done with your domain it's the stage for selecting the tenure of your hosting. I will recommend 3 years as for less time you will have to pay more.\r\n\r\n \tAs for longer duration company gives you an attractive discount.\r\n \tAlso since the hosting is very powerful sooner or later you will always need a strong hosting. If you buy only for one year then the renewal cost will kill you and will bring a huge burden. I made this mistake and still have regrets for it. Now for my hosting, i have paid for 5 years so that i can enjoy those discount without paying anything extra\r\n\r\nAfter that add the billing information and select the additional services. Among these services, the ones i highly recommend are:\r\n\r\n \tprotect site from hackers\r\n \tBackup your hard work\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have made the mistakes on not selecting these services to save few dollars and ended up paying thousands of dollars to the security expert when my websites were hacked. Also, i have lost almost 3 months so f my hard work on one of my website just because i was too lazy to take backups. Using\u00a0backup service your backups are saved automatically. You dot need SSL certificate so don't spend any money \u00a0on that\r\n\r\nYou can use the following promo code: STEVE25OFF and get instant 25% discount\r\n\r\nIf you face any difficulty in purchasing this hosting then feel free to contact me contact@makemoneyadultcontent.com , i will be happy to help\r\nBuy Hostgator Business Hosting NOW\r\nIf you are still not convinced why Hostgator is best for you then read more:\r\n\r\nHere are additional benefits:\r\n\r\n \tFree migration\r\n \tGlobal CDN\r\n \tAmazing live chat support to solve all your problem\r\n \t100% uptime - something that every major service provider strive for\r\n\r\nBuy Hostgator Business Hosting NOW\r\nI hope you like his article on\u00a0Hostgator Review - Best Wordpress hosting for Adult sites\/ porn websites\r\n\r\nToday i will talk about\u00a0Top and Best Adult web hosting companies for your porn website or adult blog. I think that i have not covered this topic correctly and it needs to be discussed in the right manner. Although i have recommended using godaddy in my\u00a0How to Make $3500 per month from adult tube websites\u00a0guide, but over the years godaddy has really degraded their performance and their hosting sucks big time now.\r\n\r\nAdult entertainment industry is growing rapidly and it is forecasted to grow even further till 2020. It has bright future and with te advent of technology and its integration with adult entertainment , new avenues have opened up and people are rushing in to make the most money in this wave. This is the perfect time to jump in and start your own adult company or business to make easy money online. Before starting the first thing you will need is a porn hosting or an adult friendly web hosting. Today in this article i discuss about the best adult hosting companies on the internet and which one to choose.\r\n\r\nLet me give you a list of adult friendly web hosting. Not every web hosting company allows adult content. Let me first define what constitutes adult content:\r\n\r\n \tAny websites that promotes or shows nudity\r\n \tPorn websites, camming websites, adult image boards, tube websites, adult landing pages\r\n \tCasino, betting are also considered adult in nature by many web hosting providers\r\n\r\nNote:\u00a0Remember child pornography, bestiality , rape, snuff and other similar areas are illegal and hence you might face jail term if your indulge in these\r\n\r\nSo if you are following any of the guide on my website then you will need an adult friendly web hosting to start your website, along with the adult domain name. I have compiled a list of all the adult hostings that will allow adult content on their servers:\r\n\r\nIf you start your porn site or adult website on a website hosting provider that does not allow adult content or porn sites, then very soon your website will get banned and all your hard work will be\u00a0lost. You wont even be allowed to take the backup in order to transfer your website. So make sure you check the TOS (terms of service) and Privacy policy of every web hosting company before joining. If you choose any company from the above list you don't have to worry about anything, as they allow adult content on their servers\r\nWhats the difference between a normal web hosting and adult site web hosting\/porn hosting?\r\nSince not all of the web hosting companies want to associate themselves with content that is adult orientated or adult in nature so they do not allow adult content on their servers. Companies like Bluehost, Siteground which are well established and have big names in hosting space stay away from adult oriented websites\r\nWhat is the best Adult web hosting, porn site hosting? Which hosting do you recommend?\r\nI have been in the adult industry for more than 6 years now and trust me i have tried many different web hosting. Although there are many hosting that is specific for one particular\u00a0type of websites. Like if you are looking for a webcam streaming then you need a VPS or a very high power hosting. But for normal adult websites, the one that I recommend and personally use for almost 30+ adult websites of mine is : Hostgator cloud business hosting\r\n\r\nI wrote a complete review for the same check it out:\u00a0Hostgator Review \u2013 Best Web hosting for Adult sites\/ porn websites  . In this article i tell you why hostgator is the best and the best steps to buy this cheap high power cloud wordpress hosting. The article also has a coupon code that will help you save 25% of total cost, so hurry and grab that coupon now.\r\nBuy hostgator hosting for adult webiste now\r\nCan i use these companies for Adult video hosting?\r\nMajority of the adult websites, be it webcam websites, adult tube websites, clip selling websites work on storage. They need a lot of storage in order to handle those heavy and big adult videos and images. Hence you need vast storage and speedy website for your visitors. Adult video hosting providers listed in this article will help you in that. But still before signing up make sure you talk to the sales representative and tell him your requirements. As unlimited storage and unlimited bandwidth is crucial for your adult website.\r\nWhat is the difference between shared and VPS adult website hosting?\r\nVPS stands for Virtual private server and is used by heavy high traffic websites. When you are using a shared hosting for your adult website then you are competing with hundreds of other websites on that particular server for resources. Because\u00a0of this limitation shared hosting are cheap. Adult shared web hosting is used by websites which are new or just starting out since the resource requirement is not that great.\r\n\r\nadult VPS web hosting is used by companies which get thousands of visitors per month. Since to handle such huge traffic they need dedicated resources and hence need a Virtual private server. You must know one thing that working with a VPS requires the expertise of a professional who can set up the VPS for your website and also can take care of day-to-day technical requirements. Shared hosting can easily be managed even by a normal non-technical person like you and me. Because of dedicated resources, these VPS hostings are expensive compared to a shared hosting\r\n\r\nSo go for Adult VPS website hosting only when you have a high traffic website and need your website to run smoothly even if thousands of visitors\u00a0visit your website at a time. With shared hosting, the growth of your website will be limited.\r\n\r\nWhat are the advantages of Adult VPS hosting:\r\n\r\n \tHigh-speed servers and resource availability\r\n \tHuge bandwidth and disk space\r\n \tYou are not competing with any other website for bandwidth and resource availability\r\n \tVPS can be easily scaled, if you think you website needs more resources then you can easily upgrade your VPS to even better configuration just by paying more\r\n \tMany companies allow Adult content on their VPS but not on shared hosting\r\n \tPage loading speed improved tremendously and hence you website will be preferred by Google in terms of search engine rankings\r\n\r\nWhat should i keep in mind before buying my adult web hosting?\r\nHere is a list of all the things you keep in mind before opting for your adult hosting company:\r\n\r\n \tSome companies charge yearly and some monthly and some pay as you go service. So decide which one suits you the best. Also make sure you properly check the refund policy (companies usually have a one month refund policy) so that if you don't like the hosting performance you are able to get he full refund without any hassle. (i recommend Hostgator)\r\n \tGo for a reputed adult hosting company. Companies like \u00a0Arvixe and Coolhandle as they have been in the game for a long time and are reliable but hostgator has came across the best. They are also not heavy on the pocket and have enough experience in the adult space.\u00a0(i recommend Hostgator)\r\n \tCustomer service is a big part in any hosting provider.

When filming adult videos or porn videos , creator or producer or director must be aware of all the rules and regulation that governs in their state or country. Many countries do not allow producing porn while others allow with some restrictions and guidelines. Here are some\r\n\r\nAs a video hosting company, a good and reliable one will give follow following rules:\r\n\r\n \tadequate warning and will make sure that minors are not allowed to visit the website.\r\n \tThey must also ensure that all the models, performers in the porn or adult video are of legal age.\r\n \tCopyrights are not infringed. If you are familiar with adult tube websites then you know how easily these websites are infringing on many copyrights because users are downloading and uploading videos without taking prior permission from the video owner.\r\n\r\nWhat are adult web hosting rules, regulation and guidelines?\r\nAdult hosting industries needs to follow many rules and regulation in order cater to their customers correctly. Similarly for adult content producers it is really important to know them beforehand before launching their adult website and adult content. Usually adult content is required not to promote rape, incest, bestiality etc in the society and is expected to follow certain law . The problem with law is that they are not universal and they differ from country to country. So your only safe bet is to first hire a lawyer who has expertise in this field and first understand the laws before moving forward with your adult site\r\n\r\nThe lawyer will be able to guide you in the right direction with the kind of content that is allowed and which is not. This way you can play it safe while also making money\r\n\r\nAlthough there are many rules that are universal in nature and almost all countries have strict laws against it.\r\n\r\n \tAge verification:\u00a0Before allowing anyone (your website visitor) to enter your website they must first go through a \"warning message\". This message is like a disclaimer that the visitor must first verify his\/her age before entering the website. As the government does not want the minors to be exposed to pornography and other forms of adult content\r\n \tobscene contents: The website content must follow certain guidelines and standards. Fro this you need to know the state law what is allowed and what is not.\r\n \tChild pornography:\u00a0This is a strictly no-no zone and highly illegal. You will be directly prosecuted if you are in any way found producing, promoting child pornography\r\n\r\nHere i have represented the laws in a tabulated manner for you to easily understand. There might be some factual errors but these have been drafted up to the best of my knowledge. If any law has been wrongly mentioned please reply in the comments section i will be happy to change it\r\n\r\nI hope you like this article on\u00a0Best Adult web hosting companies for your porn website","image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http:\/\/www.makemoneyadultcontent.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/2017-01-13_19-35-53.jpg","width":696,"height":214}}</script> </article><p class="post-tag">Tags <a href="../tag/adult-hosting/index.html" rel="tag">adult hosting</a> <a href="../tag/adult-web-hosting/index.html" rel="tag">adult web hosting</a> <a href="../tag/hostgator-adult-hosting/index.html" rel="tag">hostgator adult hosting</a> <a href="../tag/porn-hosting/index.html" rel="tag">porn hosting</a></p> <section id="author-box"><div class="block-head"><h3>About Make money adult content</h3><div class="stripe-line"></div></div><div class="post-listing"><div class="author-bio"><div class="author-avatar"> <img alt='' src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=" data-lazy-src='http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3a4ac1ecad7966acdddbb09bc560571f?s=90&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g' data-lazy-srcset='http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3a4ac1ecad7966acdddbb09bc560571f?s=180&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-90 photo' height='90' width='90'/><noscript><img alt='' src='http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3a4ac1ecad7966acdddbb09bc560571f?s=90&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g' srcset='http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3a4ac1ecad7966acdddbb09bc560571f?s=180&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-90 photo' height='90' width='90'/></noscript></div><div class="author-description"> Hi, I have been making money from adult content from last 5 years now.
