<description><![CDATA[Seriously, the popups are still awful. Even after signing up to one, or dismissing one, you get the same popups back again on every page load. You can barely get through a sentence before another one pops

A good site ruined and add me to the list of someone who won&#039;t be back as a result.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[So many damn pop-ups on this site, it&#039;s miserable. I couldn&#039;t even read a sentence without having to close another popup. Is that the strategy, bombard users with popups and hope they accidentally click one of them? This site is ridiculous. I came for some insight, and I leave by annoyance.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[i agree that a tube adult site that focusing on tier 1 county pay you more , but i have an advantage  of making an arabic adult tube because the competition is low and i can reach 1 M+ page views /month in less than 4 months , that why  i was asking about average cpm . even a 0.30 cpm would make a decent amount of money with millions of page-views a month .]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[See tube websites only source of revenue is advertisement and majority of that comes through Popads. Already getting traffic to your website is a challenge, then why would you waste your efforts on building a website with majority traffic coming from Tier-3 countries. They will never give you cpm of more than 0.5. Instead target tier-1 countries, even with less traffic you will easily get cpm over 1.7 .That&#039;s my suggestion for you.]]></description>
